Uncertainty not only decreases over time passing, but it also diminishes its impact by risk management, specifically by decision-making. At the beginning of a project, comparatively little is known about the product or work results, and so estimates are subject to large uncertainty. As more research and development is done, more information is learned about the project, and the uncertainty then tends to decrease, reaching 0% when all residual risk has been terminated or transferred. This usually happens by the end of the project i.e. by transferring the responsibilities to a separate maintenance group. The term Cone of Uncertainty is used in software development where the technical and business environments change very rapidly. However, the concept, under different names, is a well-established basic principle of cost engineering. Most environments change so slowly that they can be considered static for the duration of a typical project, and traditional project management methods therefore focus on achieving a full understanding of the environment through careful analysis and planning. Well before any significant investments are made, the uncertainty is reduced to a level where the risk can be carried comfortably. In this kind of environment the uncertainty level decreases rapidly in the beginning and the cone shape is less obvious. The software business however is very volatile and there is an external pressure to decrease the uncertainty level over time. The project must actively and continuously work to reduce the uncertainty level. The Cone of Uncertainty is narrowed both by research and by decisions that remove the sources of variability from the project. These decisions are about scope, what is included and not included in the project. If these decisions change later in the project then the cone will widen. Original research for engineering and construction in the chemical industry demonstrated that actual final costs often exceeded the earliest \"base\" estimate by as much as 100% (or underran by as much as 50%; Bauman 1958). Research in the software industry on the Cone of Uncertainty stated that in the beginning of the project life cycle (i.e. before gathering of requirements) estimates have in general an uncertainty of factor 4 on both the high side and the low side (Boehm 1981). This means that the actual effort or scope can be 4 times or 1/4 of the first estimates. This uncertainty tends to decrease over the course of a project, although that decrease is not guaranteed (McConnell 2006, p. 38).", pageId:10302338}}, {_id:1401, properties:{pageTitle:"Hand coding", pageUrl:"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hand_coding", pageId:3420503}}, {_id:1402, properties:{pageTitle:"Happy path", pageUrl:"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Happy_path", pageId:9336966}}, {_id:1403, properties:{pageTitle:"Identity transform", pageUrl:"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_transform", pageId:4081099}}, {_id:1404, properties:{pageTitle:"Integrated Water Flow Model (IWFM)", pageUrl:"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_Water_Flow_Model_%28IWFM%29", pageId:45031327}}, {_id:118, properties:{pageTitle:"Design review (U.S. government)", pageUrl:"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_review_%28U.S._government%29", pageId:23458190}}, {_id:1405, properties:{pageTitle:"Invariant (computer science)", pageUrl:"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invariant_%28computer_science%29", pageId:1126643}}, {_id:1406, properties:{pageTitle:"Ixi lang", pageUrl:"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ixi_lang", pageId:51334500}}, {_id:1407, properties:{pageTitle:"Kata (programming)", pageUrl:"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kata_%28programming%29", pageId:3697624}}, {_id:119, properties:{pageTitle:"Effort management", pageUrl:"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effort_management", abstract:"In Project Management, work activities can be measured by effort.

The old fashioned approach of beginning the expediting method once the order is already in delay isn't any longer doubtless to lead to timely delivery. Project groups have come back to understand the importance of coming up with expediting activities in conjunction with their inspection activities.Expediting is a concept in purchasing and project management for securing the quality and timely delivery of goods and components. The procurement department or an external expeditor controls the progress of manufacturing at the supplier concerning quality, packing, conformity with standards and set timelines. Thus the expeditor makes sure that the required goods arrive at the appointed date in the agreed quality at the agreed location. Expediting is especially needed in large scale projects, for example, when a power plant or a refinery is erected, because of a delay caused by late delivery or inferior quality will get very expensive and could lead to unsatisfied clients, thus the loss of a project. To save these unnecessary costs and minimize potential risks, the supplier and customer may agree on the use of a third party expediter. These are experts from companies specializing in this field who keep track of the deadlines, supervise progress on site and check whether the components are properly packed. After inspection they notify the involved parties and banks about their findings; if everything is as agreed the bank will initiate the transfer of the price of the goods to the supplier. In this way, the supplier secures his liquidity as he is paid immediately when the components leave his factory (letter of credit) and the customer/bank knows that the goods will be delivered correctly.Expediting is relevant for many industries, such as the oil and gas industry, the general energy industry and the infrastructure industry. Expediting exists in several levels: \n* production control: The expeditor inspects the factory whether the production is up to the standards of the country the goods are destined for. This is especially necessary for food or engineering equipment like power plant components. He or she controls as well whether the regular audits for ISO 9001 etc. have been made. \n* quality control: The components are tested whether they function as required and whether they are made to the measurements and standards of the customer. A part of this quality control can be the testing for compliance with standards of the destination country, e.g. ASME. \n* packing/transport survey: This is the lowest and most used level of expediting, as the goods are only counted and the packing is controlled whether it will withstand the adversities of transport (pre-shipment inspection). \n* project management: At a large-scale project, not only goods are controlled. The expediter also keeps an eye on the deadlines and milestones of the project and whether the supplier will be on time. This way he or she monitors the crucial procurement parts of the project. As the different levels of expediting require different skills, specialists and laboratories, many third party expediters specialize in only one or several of these levels, while few offer expediting services on all levels. Larger companies normally have their own expediters who can perform all four levels. Third parties then are only used when in-house capacity is overstretched or a neutral third party is needed. But In case of some big companies if the no. of project running same time, Big companies use third party expediters also. Most of the time companies use third party inspector -cum- expediters who is responsible for inspection of critical items as well as expediting. In strict quality controls conditions, those quality inspectors cum expediters will give importance to quality work than to expediting work which finally may not be useful technique to get expediting work completed.", pageId:23812132}}, {_id:125, properties:{pageTitle:"Feasibility study", pageUrl:"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feasibility_study", abstract:"Feasibility study is an assessment of the practicality of a proposed project.", pageId:1609224}}, {_id:126, properties:{pageTitle:"Front-end loading", pageUrl:"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front-end_loading", abstract:"Front-end loading (FEL), also referred to as pre-project planning (PPP), front-end engineering design (FEED), feasibility analysis, conceptual planning, programming/schematic design and early project planning, is the process for conceptual development of projects in processing industries such as upstream, petrochemical, refining and pharmaceutical. This involves developing sufficient strategic information with which owners can address risk and make decisions to commit resources in order to maximize the potential for success. Front-end loading includes robust planning and design early in a project's lifecycle (i.e., the front end of a project), at a time when the ability to influence changes in design is relatively high and the cost to make those changes is relatively low. It typically applies to industries with highly capital intensive, long lifecycle projects (i.e., hundreds of millions or billions of dollars over several years before any revenue is produced). Though it often adds a small amount of time and cost to the early portion of a project, these costs are minor compared to the alternative of the costs and effort required to make changes at a later stage in the project.

In Australia, project accounting workers earn up to an average AU$79,725 per year. Most people working in this field move to a different position after approximately 20 years. The jobs that normally increase pay towards this job is Budget Managing and Cost Accounting. Projects differ in that they frequently cross organisational boundaries, may last for anything from a few days or weeks to a number of years, during which time budgets may also be revised many times. They may also be one of a number of projects that make up a larger overall project or program. Consequently, in a project management environment costs (both direct and overhead) and revenues are also allocated to projects, which may be subdivided into a work breakdown structure, and grouped together into project hierarchies. Project accounting permits reporting at any such level that has been defined, and often allows comparison with historical as well as current budgets. Project accounting is commonly used by government contractors, where the ability to account for costs by contract (and sometimes contract line item, or CLIN) is usually a requirement for interim payments. Percentage-of-completion is frequently independently assessed by a project manager. It includes the continuous recognition of revenues and income related to longer-term projects. By doing this, the seller is able to identify some gain or loss relevant to a project in every accounting period that is ongoing active. Funding advances and actual-to-budget cost variances are calculated using the project budget adjusted to percent-of-completion. Where labor costs are a significant portion of overall project cost, it is usually necessary for employees to fill out a timesheet in order to generate the data to allocate project costs. The capital budget processes of corporations and governments are chiefly concerned with major investment projects that typically have upfront costs and longer term benefits. Investment go / no-go decisions are largely based on net present value assessments. Project accounting of the costs and benefits can provide crucially important feedback on the quality of these important decisions.

The discipline has emerged as a response to consistent problems in major projects and the need to provide confidence for project or programme stakeholders of technologically advanced, high capital or high risk projects. Project / Programme Assurance uses technical, strategic and contractual expertise to audit project plans and personnel and develop a forecast of likely technical, economic, and safety performance and critical success factors. Project assurance professionals typically serve and report to the Board of Directors of private companies and publicly held companies, governmental bodies, banking concerns (development, investment and commercial banks), insurance, surety companies, and any other entity that is responsible for project investments that often exceed $1 billion. Project assurance is in contrast with related disciplines of project management, project benchmarking, value assurance or phase–gate model and project risk assessment. It is particularly well suited for projects with a major financial decision point beyond which revisions become exceptionally expensive. An eight-step assurance procedure was outlined in a 2013 paper produced by the BT Centre for Major Programme Management at the University of Oxford. The key features of this approach to project assurance are a critical review of the project plan and personnel by an expert independent organisation with expertise in benchmarking and project execution. Project assurance is also recognised by PRojects IN Controlled Environments (PRINCE) – a project management method in an attempt to address the need in project organisation for monitoring all aspects of the project’s performance and products independently of the project manager. According to the OGC, Project Assurance helped manage risk and improved delivery confidence. Project Assurance supported SROs and others responsible for successful delivery whilst providing funders and other stakeholders with the confidence that the project could deliver to time, budget and quality. This they called the Project Assurance Function. The UK Government has also set up a project assurance organisation called the Major Projects Authority that works with HM Treasury to grow project assurance capabilities in Government and deliver project assurance services for high risk Government-sponsored projects. The term has expanded in its use to a more complete solution. It is now recognised that the original approach of audits of hard disciplines (methods, tools, processes) and soft skills (leadership, people management) need to be extended to include elements such as the context, content and complexity of a project and its environment - with appropriate levels of granularity and precision – to identify critical success factors and barriers to success. In the U.S., Project or Programme (Program) Assurance has been defined as: \"Project Assurance: An objective examination and independent assessment of a Capital Investment (Portfolio, Program, and/or Project) risks, controls, processes, and governance. Focus areas may include risk, financial, performance, compliance, system security, due diligence and/or dispute resolution engagements. Mega-Project Assurance would be specific to (Portfolios, Program, and/or Projects) that exceed $1 Billion in estimated investment value.\" “The core concepts of Mega Project Assurance: risk is governable, leadership is accountable, cost must be properly managed and is recoverable, efficiency is attainable, fraud and waste are nearly preventable, and failure is unacceptable.” J.

When a project is cancelled early on, it probably has little financial effect, but if project sponsors wait until the project has gone over budget, it can be very expensive. Software engineers and business analysts have studied the reasons for project cancellation. Most are due to poor planning or the lack of planning. The biggest worry and most troublesome concern for managers is the waste of resources that occurs when projects are cancelled. Some project cancellations are widely reported and acknowledged in the media – the most notorious example in 2005 being the failed $170 million FBI project to update their case management system. Since no one wants to admit failure, especially public companies, the vast majority of internal corporate project cancellations are performed quietly and are not as widely reported as the FBI case. However, it is generally understood by most business people that cancellations do occur regularly in their organizations. A related topic is deciding when to cancel a project. Early identification and action will permit project resources to be re-deployed to other projects. Based on the number of projects that a company is pursuing at any given time, the total value of cancelled projects could be as much as 10% of the total annual IT development budget.

It provides a preliminary delineation of roles and responsibilities, outlines the project objectives, identifies the main stakeholders, and defines the authority of the project manager. It serves as a reference of authority for the future of the project. The terms of reference are usually part of the project charter. A project charter should: \n*  Contain the essence of the project. \n*  Provide a shared understanding of the project. \n*  Act as a contract between the project sponsor, key stakeholders and the project team. The project charter is usually a short document that refers to more detailed documents such as a new offering request or a request for proposal. In Initiative for Policy Dialogue (IPD), this document is known as the project charter. In customer relationship management (CRM), it is known as the project definition report. Both IPD and CRM require this document as part of the project management process. The project charter establishes the authority assigned to the project manager, especially in a matrix management environment. It is considered industry best practice. The purpose of the project charter is to document: \n*  Reasons for undertaking the project \n*  Objectives and constraints of the project \n*  Directions concerning the solution \n*  Identities of the main stakeholders \n*  In-scope and out-of-scope items \n*  Risks identified early on (A risk management plan should be part of the overall project management plan) \n*  Target project benefits \n*  High level budget and spending authority The three main uses of the project charter are: \n*  To authorize the project - using a comparable format, projects can be ranked and authorized by Return on Investment. \n*  Serves as the primary sales document for the project - ranking stakeholders have a 1-2 page summary to distribute, present, and keep handy for fending off other project or operations runs at project resources. \n*  Serves as a focal point throughout the project. For example, it is a baseline that can be used in team meetings and in change control meetings to assist with scope management. For a large multi-phased project, the charter can be created for each individual phase. For example, there can be an initial charter during the Scope and Seek phase of a project, followed by a Planning charter and an Execution Charter during the build phase of the project. A project charter will be created in the initiating process group of a phase or a project at the very start. Developing the charter and identifying the stakeholders are the two main actions of the initiating process group. Inputs to develop a charter can be: \n*  Project Statement of Work \n*  Business Case \n*  Agreements \n*  Enterprise standards, industry standards, regulations and norms \n*  Organizational process, assets and templates Typically a project manager takes the lead in developing the charter. The project manager will employ his or her expertise and experience to develop the charter. The project manager will work with the key stakeholders (customers and business sponsors), the PMO, Subject Matter Experts inside and outside the organization, other units within the organization and may also work with Industry groups or professional bodies to develop the charter. The project manager will employ facilitation techniques such as brainstorming, problem solving, conflict resolution, meetings, expectations management etc. to develop the charter.

Her view of importance encompasses an assessment of the power, proximity and urgency associated with each stakeholder. The Stakeholder Circle methodology is described in her Doctoral thesis: Project Relationship Management and the Stakeholder Circle.

A team can be divided into sub-teams according to need. Usually project teams are only used for a defined period of time. They are disbanded after the project is deemed complete. Due to the nature of the specific formation and disbandment, project teams are usually in organizations. A team is defined as “an interdependent collection of individuals who work together towards a common goal and who share responsibility for specific outcomes of their organizations”. An additional requirement to the original definition is that “the team is identified as such by those within and outside of the team”. As project teams work on specific projects, the first requirement is usually met. In the early stages of a project, the project team may not be recognized as a team, leading to some confusion within the organization. The central characteristic of project teams in modern organizations is the autonomy and flexibility availed in the process or method undertaken to meet their goals. Most project teams require involvement from more than one department, therefore most project teams can be classified as cross functional team. The project team usually consists of a variety of members often working under the direction of a project manager or a senior member of the organization. Projects that may not receive strong support initially often have the backing of a project champion. Individual team members can either be involved on a part-time or full-time basis. Their time commitment can change throughout the project depending on the project development stage. Project teams need to have the right combination of skills, abilities and personality types to achieve collaborative tension. Teams can be formulated in a variety of ways. The most common method is at the discretion of a senior member of the organization. There are many components to becoming a top performing team, but the key is working on highly cooperative relationship. The job of management is to create relaxed and comfortable atmosphere where members are allowed to be themselves and are engaged and invested in the project work.

Risk management’s objective is to assure uncertainty does not deflect the endeavor from the business goals. Risks can come from various sources including uncertainty in financial markets, threats from project failures (at any phase in design, development, production, or sustainment life-cycles), legal liabilities, credit risk, accidents, natural causes and disasters, deliberate attack from an adversary, or events of uncertain or unpredictable root-cause. There are two types of events i.e. negative events can be classified as risks while positive events are classified as opportunities. Several risk management standards have been developed including the Project Management Institute, the National Institute of Standards and Technology, actuarial societies, and ISO standards. Methods, definitions and goals vary widely according to whether the risk management method is in the context of project management, security, engineering, industrial processes, financial portfolios, actuarial assessments, or public health and safety. Risk sources are identified and located in human factor variables, mental states and decision making as well as infrastructural or technological assets and tangible variables. The interaction between human factors and tangible aspects of risk highlights the need to focus closely on human factors as one of the main drivers for risk management, a \"change driver\" that comes first of all from the need to know how humans perform in challenging environments and in face of risks (Daniele Trevisani, 2007). As the author describes, «it is an extremely hard task to be able to apply an objective and systematic self-observation, and to make a clear and decisive step from the level of the mere \"sensation\" that something is going wrong, to the clear understanding of how, when and where to act. The truth of a problem or risk is often obfuscated by wrong or incomplete analyses, fake targets, perceptual illusions, unclear focusing, altered mental states, and lack of good communication and confrontation of risk management solutions with reliable partners. This makes the Human Factor aspect of Risk Management sometimes heavier than its tangible and technological counterpart» Strategies to manage threats (uncertainties with negative consequences) typically include avoiding the threat, reducing the negative effect or probability of the threat, transferring all or part of the threat to another party, and even retaining some or all of the potential or actual consequences of a particular threat, and the opposites for opportunities (uncertain future states with benefits). Certain aspects of many of the risk management standards have come under criticism for having no measurable improvement on risk; whereas the confidence in estimates and decisions seem to increase. For example, it has been shown that one in six IT projects experience cost overruns of 200% on average, and schedule overruns of 70%.", pageId:26404}}, {_id:1534, properties:{pageTitle:"GNU Radio", pageUrl:"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Radio", pageId:1089178}}, {_id:1535, properties:{pageTitle:"Gnuzilla", pageUrl:"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gnuzilla", pageId:7404018}}, {_id:1536, properties:{pageTitle:"Goanna (software)", pageUrl:"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goanna_%28software%29", pageId:47601260}}, {_id:1537, properties:{pageTitle:"GraphicsMagick", pageUrl:"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GraphicsMagick", pageId:1053364}}, {_id:170, properties:{pageTitle:"Risk management plan", pageUrl:"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_management_plan", abstract:"A risk management plan is a document that a project manager prepares to foresee risks, estimate impacts, and define responses to issues. It also contains a risk assessment matrix. A risk is \"an uncertain event or condition that, if it occurs, has a positive or negative effect on a project's objectives.\" Risk is inherent with any project, and project managers should assess risks continually and develop plans to address them. The risk management plan contains an analysis of likely risks with both high and low impact, as well as mitigation strategies to help the project avoid being derailed should common problems arise. Risk management plans should be periodically reviewed by the project team to avoid having the analysis become stale and not reflective of actual potential project risks. Most critically, risk management plans include a risk strategy. Broadly, there are four potential strategies, with numerous variations. Projects may choose to: \n*  Avoid risk – Change plans to circumvent the problem; \n*  Control/Mitigate risk; – Reduces impact or likelihood (or both) through intermediate steps; \n*  Accept risk – Take the chance of negative impact (or auto-insurance), eventually budget the cost (e.g. via a contingency budget line); \n*  Transfer risk – Outsource risk (or a portion of the risk – Share risk) to third party or parties that can manage the outcome. This is done financially through insurance contracts or hedging transactions, or operationally through outsourcing an activity. (Mnemonic: SARA for Share Avoid Reduce Accept, or A-CAT for \"Avoid, Control, Accept, or Transfer\") Risk management plans often include matrices. The United States Department of Defense, as part of acquisition, uses risk management planning that may have a Risk Management Plan document for the specific project. The general intent of the RMP in this context is to define the scope of risks to be tracked and means of documenting reports. It is also desired that there would be an integrated relationship to other processes. An example of this would be explaining which developmental tests verify risks of the design type were minimized are stated as part of the test and evaluation master plan. A further example would be instructions from 5000.2D that for programs that are part of a system of systems the risk management strategy shall specifically address integration and interoperability as a risk area.

Enterprise Project Management is a way of thinking, communicating and working, supported by an information system, that organizes enterprise's resources in a direct relationship to the leadership's vision and the mission, strategy, goals and objectives that move the organization forward. Simply put, EPM provides a 360 degree view of the organization's collective efforts. In recent years, with general adoption of (IT) governance practices, Enterprise Project Management has become more specific: whereas in the 1990s focus was generally on the management of the single project, in the subsequent decade, the focus lay more on the fact that a project is likely to be not the only one in the enterprise. The project co-exists with many other projects in the enterprise, or may be part of one or more programs. It may utilize (human) resources that are shared among other projects. In order to facilitate governance, it has become essential to be able to manage, monitor, and assess the status of all projects (and other assets, of course) in the enterprise, through a set of (preferably uniform) Enterprise Project Management processes, methods and application packages. Typically, organizations that adopt an Enterprise Project Management way of working, might set up a Project Management Office (PMO)/ Enterprise Project Management Office (EPMO), which is said to be more successful than a traditional PMO in addressing the priorities of the organization as its scope is enterprise-wide), might select and adopt a Project Management Methodology like PRINCE2, PMBOK (or create a proprietary method) or follow the concepts of IPMA Competence Baseline as a foundation for development and certification of project managers and their knowledge, experience and behaviour. They might even select and implement a software system to support Enterprise Project Management. An even more recent evolution in Enterprise Project Management is to not only plan and track the existing set of projects, but to create a portfolio (per budget size, per calendar year, per budget year, per business line, et cetera) of existing and future (demand) projects. This is called Project Portfolio Management. Just like the management of a portfolio of shares, Project Portfolio Management is the activity of selecting which projects to keep in portfolio (because of their anticipated value) and which ones to discard (because of their obsoleteness or because they will not yield the value that was initially calculated). Project Portfolio Management includes the creation of various scenarios to decide which is the best portfolio (for a certain year, business, budget, etcetera). Once the contents of the portfolio are agreed upon, it is key to constantly scrutinize how the individual projects are evolving in terms of quality, cost and schedule. Implementing an Enterprise Project Management toolset needs to be considered in the light of the organization's Project Management Maturity and the methodologies, processes and governance structures that are currently in place.

According to the Project Management Institute's PMBOK, Risk management is one of the ten knowledge areas in which a project manager must be competent. Project risk is defined by PMI as, \"an uncertain event or condition that, if it occurs, has a positive or negative effect on a project’s objectives.\" Project risk management remains a relatively undeveloped discipline, distinct from the risk management used by Operational, Financial and Underwriters' risk management. This gulf is due to several factors: Risk Aversion, especially public understanding and risk in social activities, confusion in the application of risk management to projects, and the additional sophistication of probability mechanics above those of accounting, finance and engineering. With the above disciplines of Operational, Financial and Underwriting risk management, the concepts of risk, risk management and individual risks are nearly interchangeable; being either personnel or monetary impacts respectively. Impacts in project risk management are more diverse, overlapping monetary, schedule, capability, quality and engineering disciplines. For this reason, in project risk management, it is necessary to specify the differences (paraphrased from the \"Department of Defense Risk, Issue, and Opportunity Management Guide for Defense Acquisition Programs\"): \n* Risk Management: Organizational policy for optimizing investments and (individual) risks to minimize the possibility of failure. \n* Risk: The likelihood that a project will fail to meet its objectives. \n* A risk: A single action, event or hardware component that contributes to an effort's \"Risk.\" An improvement on the PMBOK definition of risk management is to add a future date to the definition of a risk. Mathematically, this is expressed as a probability multiplied by an impact, with the inclusion of a future impact date and critical dates. This addition of future dates allows predictive approaches. Good Project Risk Management depends on supporting organizational factors, having clear roles and responsibilities, and technical analysis. Chronologically, Project Risk Management may begin in recognizing a threat, or by examining an opportunity. For example, these may be competitor developments or novel products. Due to lack of definition, this is frequently performed qualitatively, or semi-quantitatively, using product or averaging models. This approach is used to prioritize possible solutions, where necessary. In some instances it is possible to begin an analysis of alternatives, generating cost and development estimates for potential solutions. Once an approach is selected, more familiar risk management tools and a general project risk management process may be used for the new projects: \n*  A Planning risk management  \n*  Risk identification and monetary identification \n*  Performing qualitative risk analysis \n*  Communicating the risk to stakeholders and the funders of the project \n*  Refining or iterating the risk based on research and new information \n*  Monitoring and controlling risks Finally, risks must be integrated to provide a complete picture, so projects should be integrated into enterprise wide risk management, to seize opportunities related to the achievement of their objectives.", pageId:30603870}}, {_id:1615, properties:{pageTitle:"OpenWrt", pageUrl:"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenWrt", pageId:30863145}}, {_id:1616, properties:{pageTitle:"Pangu Team", pageUrl:"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pangu_Team", pageId:44193553}}, {_id:1617, properties:{pageTitle:"Pier Solar and the Great Architects", pageUrl:"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pier_Solar_and_the_Great_Architects", pageId:30253845}}, {_id:195, properties:{pageTitle:"Small-scale project management", pageUrl:"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small-scale_project_management", abstract:"Small-scale project management is the specific type of project management of small-scale projects.

These uncertainties are risks to the project. Some refer to these risks as \"known-unknowns\" because the estimator is aware of them, and based on past experience, can even estimate their probable costs. The estimated costs of the known-unknowns is referred to by cost estimators as cost contingency. Contingency \"refers to costs that will probably occur based on past experience, but with some uncertainty regarding the amount. The term is not used as a catchall to cover ignorance. It is poor engineering and poor philosophy to make second-rate estimates and then try to satisfy them by using a large contingency account. The contingency allowance is designed to cover items of cost which are not known exactly at the time of the estimate but which will occur on a statistical basis.\" The cost contingency which is included in a cost estimate, bid, or budget may be classified as to its general purpose, that is what it is intended to provide for. For a class 1 construction cost estimate, usually needed for a bid estimate, the contingency may be classified as an estimating and contracting contingency. This is intended to provide compensation for \"estimating accuracy based on quantities assumed or measured, unanticipated market conditions, scheduling delays and acceleration issues, lack of bidding competition, subcontractor defaults, and interfacing omissions between various work categories.\" Additional classifications of contingency may be included at various stages of a project's life, including design contingency, or design definition contingency, or design growth contingency, and change order contingency (although these may be more properly called allowances). AACE International, the Association for the Advancement of Cost Engineering, has defined contingency as \"An amount added to an estimate to allow for items, conditions, or events for which the state, occurrence, or effect is uncertain and that experience shows will likely result, in aggregate, in additional costs. Typically estimated using statistical analysis or judgment based on past asset or project experience. Contingency usually excludes: 1.  \n*  Major scope changes such as changes in end product specification, capacities, building sizes, and location of the asset or project 2.  \n*  Extraordinary events such as major strikes and natural disasters 3.  \n*  Management reserves 4.  \n*  Escalation and currency effects Some of the items, conditions, or events for which the state, occurrence, and/or effect is uncertain include, but are not limited to, planning and estimating errors and omissions, minor price fluctuations (other than general escalation), design developments and changes within the scope, and variations in market and environmental conditions. Contingency is generally included in most estimates, and is expected to be expended\". A key phrase above is that it is \"expected to be expended\". In other words, it is an item in an estimate like any other, and should be estimated and included in every estimate and every budget. Because management often thinks contingency money is \"fat\" that is not needed if a project team does its job well, it is a controversial topic. In general, there are four classes of methods used to estimate contingency. .\" These include the following: 1.  \n*  Expert judgment 2.  \n*  Predetermined guidelines (with varying degrees of judgment and empiricism used) 3.  \n*  Simulation analysis (primarily risk analysis judgment incorporated in a simulation such as Monte-Carlo) 4.  \n*  Parametric Modeling (empirically-based algorithm, usually derived through regression analysis, with varying degrees of judgment used). While all are valid methods, the method chosen should be consistent with the first principles of risk management in that the method must start with risk identification, and only then are the probable cost of those risks quantified. In best practice, the quantification will be probabilistic in nature (Monte-Carlo is a common method used for quantification). Typically, the method results in a distribution of possible cost outcomes for the project, product, or other investment. From this distribution, a cost value can be selected that has the desired probability of having a cost underrun or cost overrun. Usually a value is selected with equal chance of over or underrunning. The difference between the cost estimate without contingency, and the selected cost from the distribution is contingency. For more information, AACE International has catalogued many professional papers on this complex topic. Contingency is included in budgets as a control account. As risks occur on a project, and money is needed to pay for them, the contingency can be transferred to the appropriate accounts that need it. The transfer and its reason is recorded. In risk management, risks are continually reassessed during the course of a project, as are the needs for cost contingency.", pageId:14339638}}, {_id:212, properties:{pageTitle:"Cost database", pageUrl:"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost_database", abstract:"A cost database is a computerized database of cost estimating information, which is normally used with construction estimating software to support the formation of cost estimates.

This is similar to the concepts of inflation and deflation except that escalation is specific to an item or class of items (not as general in nature), it is often not primarily driven by changes in the money supply, and it tends to be less sustained. While escalation includes general inflation related to the money supply, it is also driven by changes in technology, practices, and particularly supply-demand imbalances that are specific to a good or service in a given economy. For example, while general inflation (e.g., consumer price index) in the US was less than 5% in the 2003-2007 time period, steel prices increased (escalated) by over 50% because of supply-demand imbalance. Cost escalation may contribute to a project cost overrun but it is not synonymous with it. Over long periods of time, as market supply and demand imbalances are corrected, escalation will tend to more-or-less equal inflation unless there are sustained technology or efficiency changes in a market. Escalation is usually calculated by examining the changes in price index measures for a good or service. Future escalation can be forecast using econometrics. Unfortunately, because escalation (unlike inflation) may occur in a micro-market, and it may be hard to measure with surveys, indices can be difficult to find. For example, the Bureau of Labor Statistics has a price index for construction wages and compensation (what the construction contractor's labor cost), but has none for the prices that owners must pay the construction contractor for their services. In cost engineering and project management usage, escalation and cost contingency are both considered risk funds, that should be included in project estimates and budgets.

By taking the right design decisions as early as during the initiation and concept phase of the product life-cycle, unnecessary costs at later stages can be avoided. But DTC also tries to capture the necessary measures for cost control during the complete development cycle. In DTC, cost considerations also become part of extended requirements specifications. In contrast to the closely related target costing, DTC does not mean a product will exactly reach a defined cost, rather, it is about \"considering cost as a design parameter in your product development activities\".

It is the amount by which a project’s expected return on investment (ROI) is reduced due to the critical path drag of a specific critical path activity Task (project management) or other specific schedule factor such as a schedule lag or other delaying constraint. Drag cost is computed at the activity level, but is caused by the impact at the project level due to: 1. A reduction in a project’s expected value because of later completion, or 2. An increase in a project’s cost due to its indirect costs being increased because of a longer project duration. Drag cost computation is often used on projects in order to justify additional project resources. For example, if a project’s expected ROI will be reduced by $5,000 for every day of duration, then an activity that has critical path drag of ten days (i.e., is delaying project completion by ten days) will have a drag cost of $50,000. If the addition of a resource that costs $10,000 would reduce the activity’s drag to five days, the drag cost would be reduced by $25,000 and the project’s expected ROI would be increased by $15,000 ($25,000 minus the additional $10,000 of resource costs). On projects which are performed for non-monetary reasons, such as public literacy programs or emergency response, drag cost can be measured in units of reduction in citizens educated or lives lost due to the additional time taken by critical path activities.

In some U.S. undergraduate Civil engineering curricula, engineering economics is a required course. It is a topic on the Fundamentals of Engineering examination, and questions might also be asked on the Principles and Practice of Engineering examination; both are part of the Professional Engineering registration process. Considering the time value of money is central to most engineering economic analyses. Cash flows are discounted using an interest rate, i, except in the most basic economic studies. For each problem, there are usually many possible alternatives. One option that must be considered in each analysis, and is often the choice, is the do nothing alternative. The opportunity cost of making one choice over another must also be considered. There are also non-economic factors to be considered, like color, style, public image, etc.; such factors are termed attributes. Costs as well as revenues are considered, for each alternative, for an analysis period that is either a fixed number of years or the estimated life of the project. The salvage value is often forgotten, but is important, and is either the net cost or revenue for decommissioning the project.

Value, as defined, is the ratio of function to cost. Value can therefore be increased by either improving the function or reducing the cost. It is a primary tenet of value engineering that basic functions be preserved and not be reduced as a consequence of pursuing value improvements. The reasoning behind value engineering is as follows: if marketers expect a product to become practically or stylistically obsolete within a specific length of time, they can design it to only last for that specific lifetime. The products could be built with higher-grade components, but with value engineering they are not because this would impose an unnecessary cost on the manufacturer, and to a limited extent also an increased cost on the purchaser. Value engineering will reduce these costs. A company will typically use the least expensive components that satisfy the product's lifetime projections. Due to the very short life spans however which is often a result of this \"value engineering technique\" planned obsolescence has become associated with product deterioration and inferior quality. Vance Packard once claimed this practice gave engineering as a whole a bad name, as it directed creative engineering energies toward short-term market ends.

The simulator is based on an approach that separates the simulation engine from the scenario editor and allows each user (or instructor) to simulate any project. The simulation engine simulates the dynamic stochastic nature of modern projects. The design of the PTB supports the system engineering approach to Problem solving as each scenario presents the requirements, the alternatives that can be selected and the constraints imposed on the solution. The user has to trade off the cost, schedule, risk, and benefits to the stake holders and to find a feasible, robust, good solution for the scenario. The solution is then simulated by the simulation engine while the trainee exercises monitoring and control throughout the execution.A planned project can be simulated using Monte Carlo simulation. This is done in automatic mode (without a human decision maker involved) and shows the probability to finish the project at any time period or at any cost. Furthermore, based on the Monte Carlo simulation the probability of each activity to be on the critical path is estimated (the criticality index).

A deliverable could be a report, a document, a software product, a server upgrade or any other building block of an overall project. A deliverable may be composed of multiple smaller deliverables. It may be either an outcome to be achieved (as in \"The corporation says that becoming profitable this year is a deliverable.\") or an output to be provided (as in \"The deliverable for the completed project consists of a special-purpose electronic device and its controlling software.\"). A deliverable differs from a project milestone in that a milestone is a measurement of progress toward an output, whereas the deliverable is the result of the process. For a typical project, a milestone might be the completion of a product design, while the deliverable might be the technical diagram or detailed design report of the product. A deliverable is more than just a project document in that a project document is typically part of a project deliverable. A project deliverable may contain a number of documents and physical things. In technical projects, deliverables can be further classified as hardware, software, or design documents. In contracted efforts, deliverable may refer to an item specifically required by contract documents, such as an item on a Contract Data Requirements List or mentioned in the statement of work (SoW). A deliverable is something (hard or soft) that can be ready to dispatch to the site or the client as a partial item of the supply foreseen in the contract, e.g. when the project has started some part of the design (when settled), can be anticipated to the sub-supplier who has therefore the possibility of starting his purchase activity of raw material, even if many other parameters are not yet designed by the designer.

As of 2005, Earned Schedule is designated as an \"emerging practice\" by the Project Management Institute. It was introduced in 2003 a seminal article \"Schedule is Different\"  by Walter Lipke, in The Measurable News, the quarterly magazine of the College of Performance Management, of the Project Management Institute. Traditionally, EVM tracks schedule variances not in units of time, but in units of currency (e.g. dollars) or quantity (e.g. labor hours). Of course, it is more natural to speak of schedule performance in units of time, but the problems with traditional schedule performance metrics are even deeper. Near the end of a project -- when schedule performance is often a primary concern -- the usefulness of traditional schedule metrics is demonstrably poor. In traditional EVM, a schedule variance (SV) of 0 or a schedule performance index (SPI) of 1 indicates that a project is exactly on schedule. However, when a project is completed, its SV is always 0 and SPI is always 1, even if the project was delivered unacceptably late. Similarly, a project can languish near completion (e.g. SPI = 0.95) and never be flagged as outside acceptable numerical tolerance. (Using traditional SV as an exception threshold, it is not uncommon that an SPI > 0.9 is considered acceptable.) To correct these problems, Earned Schedule theory represents the two measures SV and SPI in 2 separate domains: currency and time. They are named as SV($) and SPI($), to indicate they relate to currency; and SV(t) and SPI(t), to indicate they relate to time. A stated advantage of Earned Schedule methods is that no new data collection processes are required to implement and test Earned Schedule; it only requires updated formulas. Earned Schedule theory also provides updated formulas for predicting project completion date, using the time-based measures. It has been stated that Earned Schedule provides a useful link between traditional Earned Value Analysis and traditional project schedule analysis -- a link that some say has been missing in traditional EVM theory.", pageId:4397585}}, {_id:1727, properties:{pageTitle:"Binary patch", pageUrl:"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_patch", pageId:60348063}}, {_id:1728, properties:{pageTitle:"Continuous delivery", pageUrl:"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_delivery", pageId:33957671}}, {_id:1729, properties:{pageTitle:"Continuous deployment", pageUrl:"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_deployment", pageId:36120070}}, {_id:252, properties:{pageTitle:"Float (project management)", pageUrl:"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Float_%28project_management%29", pageId:401024}}, {_id:1730, properties:{pageTitle:"Deployment environment", pageUrl:"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deployment_environment", pageId:46981896}}, {_id:1731, properties:{pageTitle:"Early access", pageUrl:"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_access", pageId:40811072}}, {_id:1732, properties:{pageTitle:"End of life announcement", pageUrl:"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End_of_life_announcement", pageId:42005975}}, {_id:1733, properties:{pageTitle:"End-of-life (product)", pageUrl:"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-of-life_%28product%29", pageId:300571}}, {_id:1734, properties:{pageTitle:"Feature complete", pageUrl:"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_complete", pageId:12241099}}, {_id:1735, properties:{pageTitle:"Hotfix", pageUrl:"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotfix", pageId:1315081}}, {_id:1736, properties:{pageTitle:"Last order date", pageUrl:"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_order_date", pageId:42005956}}, {_id:1737, properties:{pageTitle:"Maintenance release", pageUrl:"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maintenance_release", pageId:6960642}}, {_id:1738, properties:{pageTitle:"Patch (computing)", pageUrl:"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patch_%28computing%29", pageId:475153}}, {_id:1739, properties:{pageTitle:"Perpetual beta", pageUrl:"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perpetual_beta", pageId:3342298}}, {_id:1740, properties:{pageTitle:"Point release", pageUrl:"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_release", pageId:3977488}}, {_id:253, properties:{pageTitle:"Gantt chart", pageUrl:"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gantt_chart", abstract:"A Gantt chart is a type of bar chart, devised by Henry Gantt in the 1910s, that illustrates a project schedule.

It usually consists of short amounts of work that must be repeated periodically. Examples of such an activity may be project budget accounting, customer liaison, or oiling machinery during manufacturing. Since an LOE activity is not itself a work item directly associated with accomplishing the final project product, service or result, but rather one that supports such work, its duration is based on the duration of the discrete work activity it is supporting — oiling machinery will start when manufacturing starts and finish when it finishes. As a result, an LOE activity should never be on the critical path of the project schedule, as it never of itself adds time to the project. Rather, manufacturing would be on the critical path, and the oiling activity would become shorter or longer only if manufacturing does. LOE activities should not have variances either, because they cannot be ahead of or behind schedule based on their meaning. In inserting LOE activities to a critical path method schedule, the LOE is usually scheduled as both a start-to-start (SS) and finish-to-finish successor of the driving activity. In a network logic diagram, these two relationships make it look as though the LOE is hanging from the start and finish of the discrete activity. As a result, an LOE thus diagrammed is sometimes referred to as a \"hammock\" activity or relationship.

Initially, the project scope is defined and the appropriate methods for completing the project are determined. Following this step, the durations for the various tasks necessary to complete the work are listed and grouped into a work breakdown structure. Project planning is often used to organize different areas of a project, including project plans, work loads and the management of teams and individuals. The logical dependencies between tasks are defined using an activity network diagram that enables identification of the critical path. Project planning is inherently uncertain as it must be done before the project is actually started. Therefore the duration of the tasks is often estimated through a weighted average of optimistic, normal, and pessimistic cases. The critical chain method adds \"buffers\" in the planning to anticipate potential delays in project execution. Float or slack time in the schedule can be calculated using project management software. Then the necessary resources can be estimated and costs for each activity can be allocated to each resource, giving the total project cost. At this stage, the project schedule may be optimized to achieve the appropriate balance between resource usage and project duration to comply with the project objectives. Once established and agreed, the project schedule becomes what is known as the baseline schedule. Progress will be measured against the baseline schedule throughout the life of the project. Analyzing progress compared to the baseline schedule is known as earned value management. The inputs of the project planning phase 2 include the project charter and the concept proposal. The outputs of the project planning phase include the project requirements, the project schedule, and the project management plan. The Project Planning can be done manually.

When more resources such as machines or people are needed than are available, or perhaps a specific person is needed in both tasks, the tasks will have to be rescheduled concurrently or even sequentially to manage the constraint. Project planning resource leveling is the process of resolving these conflicts. It can also be used to balance the workload of primary resources over the course of the project[s], usually at the expense of one of the traditional triple constraints (time, cost, scope). When using specially designed project software, leveling typically means resolving conflicts or over allocations in the project plan by allowing the software to calculate delays and update tasks automatically. Project management software leveling requires delaying tasks until resources are available. In more complex environments, resources could be allocated across multiple, concurrent projects thus requiring the process of resource leveling to be performed at company level. In either definition, leveling could result in a later project finish date if the tasks affected are in the critical path. Resource leveling is also useful in the world of maintenance management. Many organizations have maintenance backlogs. These backlogs consist of work orders. In a \"planned state\" these work orders have estimates such as 2 electricians for 8 hours. These work orders have other attributes such as report date, priority, asset operational requirements, and safety concerns. These same organizations have a need to create weekly schedules. Resource-leveling can take the \"work demand\" and balance it against the resource pool availability for the given week. The goal is to create this weekly schedule in advance of performing the work. Without resource-leveling the organization (planner, scheduler, supervisor) is most likely performing subjective selection. For the most part, when it comes to maintenance scheduling, there is less, if any, task interdependence, and therefore less need to calculate critical path and total float. The chart shows the number of people involved in a project and its change with time.

These include discussions on functional vs. cross-functional resource allocation as well as processes espoused by organizations like the Project Management Institute (PMI) through their Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK) methodology of project management. Resource management is a key element to activity resource estimating and project human resource management. Both are essential components of a comprehensive project management plan to execute and monitor a project successfully. As is the case with the larger discipline of project management, there are resource management software tools available that automate and assist the process of resource allocation to projects and portfolio resource transparency including supply and demand of resources.

This pretense continually moves forward past one project checkpoint to the next, possibly continuing right up until the functionality is actually due. The practice of schedule chicken often results in contagious schedules slips due to the inter team dependencies and is difficult to identify and resolve, as it is in the best interest of each team not to be the first bearer of bad news. The psychological drivers underlining the \"Schedule Chicken\" behavior are related to the Hawk-Dove or Snowdrift model of conflict used by players in game theory. The term derives from the game of chicken played between drivers, as depicted in the movie Rebel Without a Cause, in which two drivers race their hot-rods towards a cliff edge.

It is the application of the Toyota Production System to construction, with two parallel paths: measuring (ASTM E2691) and improving productivity, and segregating and externalizing work through prefabrication and supply chain management. Like the Toyota Production System, Agile construction is a system that relies on input from the source of the work information, both up front for planning the project, as well as throughout the life of a project for real-time feedback. The real-time input produces real-time measurements of productivity. It is an iterative and incremental method of managing the design and build activities. This means that each time the process is repeated some changes are made to make the process better. Changes for the better are kept and for the worse are discarded. Agile Construction is based on 7 principles or pillars: \n* Labor productivity and measurement \n* Job scheduling and planning \n* Procurement management \n* Prefabrication (components or parts already enssembled by the supplier, reducing time and complexity of the task) \n* Reduction of labor composite rate (the cost of the worker to the company per unit of time) \n* Estimation accuracy and improvement  \n* Project financial management Agile Construction improves the contractor's ability to rapidly adapt to job site changes, minimizing the time between when a risk is detected and corrected. This requires a better mechanism to capture these changes and a better infrastructure for addressing them.Agile project management applied for construction can also make gains in pre-design and design phases of construction, and with a more highly trained and motivated work deliver a better consumer value.", pageId:45644471}}, {_id:496, properties:{pageTitle:"Architectural management", pageUrl:"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architectural_management", abstract:"Architectural management falls into two distinct parts, office management and project management (Brunton et al., 1964; Emmitt, 1999a & 1999b).

Office management involves the allocation and financing of resources, principally premises, trained staff and computer systems, and on establishing and charging appropriate fees for the services rendered. Project management focuses on timescales, developing a design from initial concept to working drawings, and managing the construction process (see for example Emmitt, 2014).

In the United States construction industry, contract agreements are usually written to allow the owner to withhold (retain) the final payment to the general contractor as \"retainage\". The contractor is bound by the contract to complete a list of contract items, called a punch list, in order to receive final payment from the owner. The designer (typically a licensed Professional Architect or Engineer), is usually also incorporated into the contract as the owner's design representative and agent, to verify that completed contract work has complied with the design. In most contracts, the General Conditions to the Contract for Construction requires the Contractor, when he believes it to be so, to declare the construction project to have reached \"substantial completion\" and request a \"pre-final\" inspection. According to the General Conditions (AIA A201 Section 9.8.2), the Contractor prepares and submits to the Architect a comprehensive list of items to be completed or corrected. This snag list, generated by the Contractor is known as the punch list. Upon receipt of the Contractor's list, the Architect then inspects the work to determine if the Work is \"substantially complete.\" Final contractor payment is made when the punch list of items are completed to meet the project design required by the contract, or some other mutually agreed resolution for each item is reached. Examples of punch list items include damaged building components (e.g. repair broken window, replace stained wallboard, repair cracked paving, etc.), or problems with the final installation of building materials or equipment (e.g. reinstall peeling carpet, replace missing roof shingles, fire and pressure test boiler, obtain elevator use permit, activate security system, etc.).

Therefore, software development may include research, new development, prototyping, modification, reuse, re-engineering, maintenance, or any other activities that result in software products. Software can be developed for a variety of purposes, the three most common being to meet specific needs of a specific client/business (the case with custom software), to meet a perceived need of some set of potential users (the case with commercial and open source software), or for personal use (e.g. a scientist may write software to automate a mundane task). Embedded software development, that is, the development of embedded software such as used for controlling consumer products, requires the development process to be integrated with the development of the controlled physical product.

UNWIND [{_id:541, properties:{pageTitle:"Essential complexity", pageUrl:"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essential_complexity", abstract:"Essential complexity is a numerical measure defined by McCabe in his highly cited, 1976 paper better known for introducing cyclomatic complexity. McCabe, defined essential complexity as the cyclomatic complexity of the reduced CFG (control flow graph) after iteratively replacing (reducing) all structured programming control structures, i.e. those having a single entry point and a single exit point (for example if-then-else and while loops) with placeholder single statements. McCabe's reduction process is intended to simulate the conceptual replacement of control structures (and actual statements they contain) with subroutine calls, hence the requirement for the control structures to have a single entry and a single exit point. (Nowadays a process like this would fall under the umbrella term of refactoring.) All structured programs evidently have an essential complexity of 1 as defined by McCabe because they can all be iteratively reduced to a single call to a top-level subroutine. As McCabe explains in his paper, his essential complexity metric was designed to provide a measure of how far off this ideal (of being completely structured) a given program was. Thus greater than 1 essential complexity numbers, which can only be obtained for non-structured programs, indicate that they are further away from the structured programming ideal. To avoid confusion between various notions of reducibility to structured programs, it's important to note that McCabe's paper briefly discusses and then operates in the context of a 1973 paper by S. Rao Kosaraju, which gave a refinement (or alternative view) of the structured program theorem. The seminal 1966 paper of Böhm and Jacopini showed that all programs can be [re]written using only structured programming constructs, (aka the D structures: sequence, if-then-else, and while-loop), however, in transforming a random program into a structured program additional variables may need to be introduced (and used in the tests) and some code may be duplicated. In their paper, Böhm and Jacopini conjectured, but did not prove that it was necessary to introduce such additional variables for certain kinds of non-structured programs in order to transform them into structured programs. An example of program (that we now know) does require such additional variables is a loop with two conditional exits inside it. In order to address the conjecture of Böhm and Jacopini, Kosaraju defined a more restrictive notion of program reduction than the Turing equivalence used by Böhm and Jacopini. Essentially, Kosaraju's notion of reduction imposes, besides the obvious requirement that the two programs must compute the same value (or not finish) given the same inputs, that the two programs must use the same primitive actions and predicates, the latter understood as expressions used in the conditionals. Because of these restrictions, Kosaraju's reduction does not allow the introduction of additional variables; assigning to these variables would create new primitive actions and testing their values would change the predicates used in the conditionals. Using this more restrictive notion of reduction, Kosaraju proved Böhm and Jacopini's conjecture, namely that a loop with two exits cannot be transformed into a structured program without introducing additional variables, but went further and proved that programs containing multi-level breaks (from loops) form a hierarchy, such that one can always find a program with multi-level breaks of depth n that cannot be reduced to a program of multi-level breaks with depth less than n, again without introducing additional variables. McCabe notes in his paper that in view of Kosaraju's results, he intended to find a way to capture the essential properties of non-structured programs in terms of their control flow graphs. He proceeds by first identifying the control flow graphs corresponding to the smallest non-structured programs (these include branching into a loop, branching out of a loop, and their if-then-else counterparts) which he uses to formulate a theorem analogous to Kuratowski's theorem, and thereafter he introduces his notion of essential complexity in order to give a scale answer (\"measure of the structuredness of a program\" in his words) rather than a yes/no answer to the question of whether a program's control flow graph is structured or not. Finally, the notion of reduction used by McCabe to shrink the CFG is not the same as Kosaraju's notion of reducing flowcharts. The reduction defined on the CFG does not know or care about the program's inputs, it is simply a graph transformation. For example, the following C program fragment has an essential complexity of 1, because the inner if statement and the for can be reduced, i.e. it is a structured program. for(i=0;i<3;i++) {      if(a[i] == 0) b[i] += 2;   } The following C program fragment has an essential complexity of four; its CFG is irreducible. The program finds the first row of z which is all zero and puts that index in i; if there is none, it puts -1 in i. for(i=0;i<m;i++) {    for(j=0;j<n;j++) {      if(z[i][j] != 0)        goto non_zero;    }    goto found;non_zero:  }  i = -1;found: The idea of CFG reducibility by successive collapses of sub-graphs (ultimately to a single node for well-behaved CFGs) is also used in modern compiler optimization. However the notion from structured programming of single-entry and single-exit control structure is replaced with that of natural loop, which is defined as a \"single-entry, multiple-exit loop, with only a single branch back to the entry from within it\". The areas of the CFG that cannot be reduced to natural loops are called improper regions; these regions end up having a fairly simple definition: multiple-entry, strongly connected components of the CFG. The simplest improper region is thus a loop with two entry points. Multiple exits do not cause analysis problems in modern compilers. Improper regions (multiple-entries into loops) do cause additional difficulties in optimizing code.", pageId:2842330}}, {_id:542, properties:{pageTitle:"Feature creep", pageUrl:"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_creep", pageId:73528}}, {_id:543, properties:{pageTitle:"Feature-driven development", pageUrl:"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature-driven_development", abstract:"Feature-driven development (FDD) is an iterative and incremental software development process.

Associated with the software release life cycle, it was said by Boris Debic of Google Inc. that release engineering is to software engineering as manufacturing is to an industrial process: Release engineering is the difference between manufacturing software in small teams or startups and manufacturing software in an industrial way that is repeatable, gives predictable results,and scales well. These industrial style practices not only contribute to the growth of a company but also arekey factors in enabling growth. The importance of release engineering in enabling growth of a technology company has been repeatedly argued by John O'Duinn and Bram Adams. While it is not the goal of release engineering to encumber software development with a process overlay, it is often seen as a sign of organizational and developmental maturity. Modern release engineering is concerned with several aspects of software production: Identifiability Being able to identify all of the source, tools, environment, and other components that make up a particular release. Reproducibility The ability to integrate source, third party components, data, and deployment externals of a software system in order to guarantee operational stability. Consistency The mission to provide a stable framework for development, deployment, audit and accountability for software components. Agility The ongoing research into what are the repercussions of modern software engineering practices on the productivity in the software cycle, e.g. continuous integration and push on green initiatives. Release engineering is often the integration hub for more complex software development teams, sitting at the cross between development, product management, quality assurance and other engineering efforts, also known as DevOps. Release engineering teams are often cast in the role of gatekeepers (e.g. at Facebook, Google, Microsoft) for certain critical products where their judgement forms a parallel line of responsibility and authority in relation to production releases (pushes). Frequently, tracking of changes in a configuration management system or revision control system is part of the domain of the release engineer. The responsibility for creating and applying a version numbering scheme into software—and tracking that number back to the specific source files to which it applies—often falls onto the release engineer. Producing or improving automation in software production is usually a goal of the release engineer. Gathering, tracking, and supplying all the tools that are required to develop and build a particular piece of software may be a release engineering task, in order to reliably reproduce or maintain software years after its initial release to customers. While most software engineers, or software developers, do many or all of the above as a course of their work, in larger organizations the specialty of the release engineer can be applied to coordinate disparate source trees, projects, teams, and components. This frees the developers to implement features in the software and also frees the quality assurance engineers to more broadly and deeply test the produced software. The release engineer may provide software, services, or both to software engineering and software quality assurance teams. The software provided may be build tools, assembly, or other reorganization scripts which take compilation output and place them into a pre-defined tree structure, and even to the authoring and creation of installers for use by test teams or by the ultimate consumer of the software.

It has been part of the Rational Objectory Process after reviews by Dyrhage and Bylund and moved on to play a more important role in the RUP in 1998 when it served as the initial page for using the digital version of the process. Its final form was published by Kruchten in 1998. An older version as later used by Jacobson, Booch and Rumbaugh  and an altered version was used by Royce. Over the years, this diagram has become increasingly connected with RUP, so that sometimes it is regarded as a logo for the process. The chart has then since been spread widely over the Internet. A known misconception about the hump chart is, that it is based on empirical assessment of actual projects rather than on Kruchten's educated guess. ...I always insisted that these humps were just illustrative, as well as the number and duration of iterations shown on the horizontal axis, but many people wanted to read much more meaning in that diagram than I intended. For example, a gentleman from Korea once wrote me to ask for a large original diagram to measure the heights, and ‘integrate' the area under the humps, to help him do project estimation...

S.P.L.O.T's source code (as well as its main library SPLAR) are freely available on GitHub and have been successfully extended by others to address different research needs. A common task in Software Product Lines is the analysis of feature models. Analysis tasks can include checking the validity of the feature model (i.e., whether the model has at least one valid configuration), counting valid configurations, detecting 'dead' features, and so on. S.P.L.O.T. offers an analysis tool that can help practitioners to analyse and reason on feature models.

Before any workers are hired on the project, construction unions have bargaining rights to determine the wage rates and benefits of all employees working on the particular project and to agree to the provisions of the agreement. The terms of the agreement apply to all contractors and subcontractors who successfully bid on the project, and supersedes any existing collective bargaining agreements. PLAs are used on both public and private projects, and their specific provisions may be tailored by the signatory parties to meet the needs of a particular project. The agreement may include provisions to prevent any strikes, lockouts, or other work stoppages for the length of the project. PLAs typically require that employees hired for the project are referred through union hiring halls, that nonunion workers pay union dues for the length of the project, and that the contractor follow union rules on pensions, work conditions and dispute resolution. PLAs are authorized under the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA), 29 U.S.C. §§ 151-169. Sections 8(e) and (f) of the NLRA, 29 U.S.C. §§ 158(e) and (f) make special exceptions from other requirements of the NLRA in order to permit employers to enter into pre-hire agreements with labor unions in the construction industry. The agreements have been in use in the United States since the 1930s, and first became the subject of debate in the 1980s, for their use on publicly funded projects. In these instances, government entities made signing PLAs a condition of working on taxpayer funded projects. This type of PLA, known as a government-mandated PLA, is distinct from a PLA voluntarily entered into by contractors on public or private work—as is permitted by the NLRA—as well as a PLA mandated by a private entity on a privately funded construction project. Executive orders issued since 1992 have affected the use of government-mandated PLAs for federal construction projects and the most recent order, issued by President Barack Obama in February 2009, encourages their use by federal agencies. The use of PLAs is opposed by a number of groups, who argue that the agreements discriminate against non-union contractors and do not improve efficiency or reduce costs of construction projects. Studies of PLAs have mixed results, with some studies concluding that PLAs have a favorable impact, while others find that the agreements can increase costs, and may negatively impact non-union contractors and workers.", pageId:23733632}}, {_id:706, properties:{pageTitle:"Rebar detailing", pageUrl:"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebar_detailing", abstract:"Rebar detailing is the discipline of preparing 'shop/placing' drawings or shop drawings of steel reinforcement for construction.

Using Agile Applications development paradigms, a set of services can be built to address business specific functional components. These services can be exposed using any one of the standard communication protocols including web services. A well designed Agile Application will standardize on a common communication protocol and a common data model. The services can then be orchestrated using a decoupled layer to implement business logic. There are many tools by different vendors(IBM, Intel etc.,) in the industry that can support the orchestration layer. The decoupled nature of an Agile Application permits it to accommodate fault tolerance and scalability. For example, scalability is addressed through focusing the attention of the QA team in the set of services that are causing the bottleneck as opposed to trying to solve scalability for the entire system which can be a much bigger problem. Similarly, fault tolerance can be achieved through deploying multiple instances of a service. If one service fails, another instance can pick up the load. For stateless services, this can lead to continuous availability. Following the Agile Development paradigm, each unit of development cycle can be focused on a single service.

The term was coined by HAL Software (Ireland) in 2013. Traditionally, industrial automation software has been developed using languages that do not fully implement object-oriented programming. Software development lifecycle is in line with the Waterfall model. For example, the GxP (Good Automated manufacturing practice) V model that is pervasive throughout the pharmaceutical regulated industries. There was a growing belief however that the model was too rigid, did not allow for sufficient change throughout the software development lifecycle and did not target testing according to risk. The latest version of the GxP model went some way towards testing based on risk assessment. The latest GxP model advocates testing and documenting according to perceived risk to the end user. (The patient, in the case of the Pharmaceutical industry). In fact the GAMP5 guide in 2008 explicitly mentioned Agile programming; \"The approach described in this document is designed to be compatible with a wide range of other models, methods, and schemes, including: Software development methods such as RAD, Agile, RUP, or Extreme programming.\" (GAMP5) There is debate however over whether Agile methods can truly satisfy regulatory requirements, as outlined in the article on Alternative Software development models and methods in GxP Environments, by ISAP GMAP D_A_C_H SIG ASDMM. (Pharmaceutical Engineering Jan2012 Vol32 No.1). The Industry has some experience of poorly executed MES Agile software projects and these experiences have tended to reinforce the traditional notion that Waterfall software development lifecycle is the simplest way to enforce Engineering Rigour and budgetary/schedule contraints on a software development team. Agile Automation software development has the potential to reduce the development lifecycle and at the same time, encompass automated unit testing. Something that the industry is calling for. In addition, the \"don't repeat yourself\" aspects of Agile object oriented software development encompassing extension of software classes through interfaces (Software class is open for extension but closed for modification) are very attractive in a regulated industry where software change validation is particularly expensive. Agile software development promotes true object oriented software programming which in turn results in software that is more amenable to change and less likely to break. The two most widely used strategy design patterns in Pharmaceutical and other Batch Industrial Automation higher level systems (SCADA, Batch and MES ) are ISA S88 & ISA S95. These patterns can be implemented such that the action behaviours (e.g., read/write method or Valve command on/off method) are encapsulated as interfaces using languages such C#, or Java. Commercial Control System software development is biased towards inheritance and subtyping, and the other OOP tenets (Encapsulation, Polymorphism) are not exposed to the programmer to the same extent. This incomplete OOP implementation increases the amount of design effort required. Even Commercial Proprietary DCS systems such as Emerson DeltaV are biased towards subtyping and inheritance without an easy way to implement a behaviour through an interface or similar construct. (There is no way to implement multiple inheritance.) The IEC 61131-3 programming language is the most widely used language for programming PLC & DCS systems. It is not a truly object oriented language, implementing only 1 tenet of OOP (inheritance/subtyping) and not encapsulation or polymorphism. This limits its amenability to automated unit testing and encapsulating of behaviours for class extension. Generally there is less scope for encapsulating behaviours in most industrial controllers except for platforms that run a more advanced operating system (for example the Beckhoff Twincat platform) that can be programmed via high level IDEs such as visual studio. There is a replacement standard (IEC 61499) that is more object oriented, but industry uptake is small. There are moves towards IEC61131-3 consolidation, notably through the PLCOpen standard. This approach to developing an abstract XML class can result in a library of tested class modules/types that can subsequently be instantiated and imported to target platform. Interest is growing in model driven architecture (MDA) Agile programming whereby a platform independent model is first developed. As a result of regulatory filing requirements and the need to protect against litigation, the Pharmaceutical industry records and saves data that must be reconstituted for subsequent filing submittal or Batch release (Electronic batch records).
