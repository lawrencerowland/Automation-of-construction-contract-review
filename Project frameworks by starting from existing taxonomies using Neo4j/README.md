<p>There is an excellent <a href="https://jbarrasa.com/2017/04/26/quickgraph6-building-the-wikipedia-knowledge-graph-in-neo4j-qg2-revisited/#more-4705">post</a> from <a href="https://jbarrasa.com/">Jes√∫s Barrasa</a> showing how to add Wikidata and DBPedia information to a Neo4j graph. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This would be a way to get started with building a knowledge graph for any topic. e.g. a knowledge base of team operations. Start from the Wikidata structure, then combine it with special team knowledge and practice. </p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I have taken Project Management information from wikidata, placed it in Neo4j, and then visualised it in the  YfilesNeo4j Explorer. </p>

<p>When you get down to page level, there are hundreds of nodes, so I have zoomed into one part of the graph below, by visualising the results in the excellent Yfiles Neo4j Explorer application.</p>

<p>To create your own, just follow the instructions, but as per the comment at the bottom of the post change the cypher code from "doit" to 'doIt' where necessary. </p>
