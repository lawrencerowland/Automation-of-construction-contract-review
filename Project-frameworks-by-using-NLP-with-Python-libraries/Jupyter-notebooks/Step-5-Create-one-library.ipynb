The principles \\npresented in the SAPs are supplemented by a suite of guides to further assist \\nONR’s inspectors in their technical assessment work in support of making \\nregulatory judgements and decisions.  This Technical Assessment Guide (TAG) \\nis one of these guides. \\n\\n2. \\n\\nPURPOSE AND SCOPE \\n\\nThis Technical Assessment Guide provides guidance on ONR’s approach to \\nthe control of nuclear matter, the relevant legislative constraints and definitions \\nand on the application of relevant ONR Safety Assessment Principles (SAPs) \\n[1], as described in section 4.1 below. \\n\\nNuclear matter must be controlled to protect people from harm and to protect \\nthe environment, safeguard fissile material and to secure hazardous \\ninstallations and materials. Harm may result from the radioactive properties of \\nnuclear matter, or by combination of its radioactive properties with toxic, \\nexplosive or other hazardous properties. Recognition of the impact that? \\nnuclear matter may have on safety is implicit throughout the SAPs. \\n\\n2.3 \\n\\nThe principal definition of nuclear matter used by ONR is that given in the \\nglossary to the SAPs, based on the definition used in the Nuclear Installations \\nAct (NIA): \\n\\nSubject to any exceptions prescribed in NIA and the Nuclear Installations \\n(Excepted Matter) Regulations 2017[2], nuclear matter is: \\n\\n1  any  fissile  material  in  the  form  of  uranium  metal,  alloy  or \\nchemical  compound  (including  natural  uranium),  or  of  plutonium \\nmetal,  alloy  or  chemical  compound,  and  any  other  fissile  material \\nwhich may be prescribed;  \\n\\n2  any  radioactive  material  produced  in,  or  made  radioactive  by \\nexposure to the radiation incidental to, the process of producing or \\nutilising any such fissile material as aforesaid. \\n\\nIt should be noted that following the commencement of the Nuclear Safeguards \\nAct 2018 the definition of “qualifying nuclear material” overlaps the definition of \\nexcepted matter arising through NIA and as such, material that may meet the \\ncriteria to be considered as excepted matter may still be qualifying nuclear \\nmaterial for safeguards purposes.  In any case involving such material, ONR \\nSafeguards should be consulted. \\n\\nThis guidance therefore applies to all types of nuclear matter, including \\nexcepted matter (see the Appendix) unless the wording makes it clear that \\nlimited application was intended, or unless it can be shown that the total \\namount of nuclear matter concerned is sufficiently small or is in such a \\nchemical or physical form as to make it unnecessary to apply to any one or \\nmore of the SAPs. The SAPs require the identification of “all initiating faults \\nhaving the potential to lead to ….. a significant quantity of radioactive \\nmaterial escaping from its designated place of residence or confinement” \\n(fault analysis principle FA.2). \\n\\nReport  NS-TAST-GD-023 \\nCM9 Ref: 2019/0250250 \\n\\nPage 2 of 14 \\n\\nOFFICIAL \\n \\n\\n\\x0cOffice for Nuclear Regulation  \\n \\n \\n\\nOFFICIAL \\n\\n2.6 \\n\\nInterpretation of “control” should not be restricted to the need for control and \\ninstrumentation (C&I) systems. In this context, control relates to the ability to \\nmanage a hazardous material. However, the legislation does not define fully the \\ntype of control required, for example, Licence Condition (LC) 4 states only that \\n“adequate arrangements” should exist for nuclear matter brought onto site. \\n\\n2.7 \\n\\nThe nature of the control required can be determined from a number of \\nsources, including (in no particular order): \\n\\n\\uf0b7 \\n\\n\\uf0b7 \\n\\n\\uf0b7 \\n\\n\\uf0b7 \\n\\n\\uf0b7 \\n\\n\\uf0b7 \\n\\n\\uf0b7 \\n\\n\\uf0b7 \\n\\nLegislation, primary and secondary. \\n\\nthe nuclear site licence conditions . \\n\\nPublished standards. \\n\\nONR’s  Safety  Assessment  Principles  and  Technical  Assessment \\nGuides. \\n\\nComparison with relevant good practice in the UK and abroad. \\n\\nGood design and analysis of appropriate systems and equipment. \\n\\nLegal Guidance from ONR’s solicitors or legal advisory service. \\n\\nFor  material  meeting  the  criteria  to  be  “qualifying  nuclear  matter”, \\nSafeguards requirements. \\n\\nThis guidance covers the key concepts of inventory control. In this context, \\ncontrol should be applied proportionately and according to the meanings of \\nrelevant ONR guidance, for example on limits and conditions [3] and functional \\nsafety systems [4]. \\n\\nNuclear matter has to be managed through all stages in the life-cycle of a \\nfacility and most of the SAPs will apply to nuclear matter at some stage.  Many \\nspecific principles in other sub-sections are particularly relevant, e.g. \\ncontainment and ventilation [SAP-ECV.1 to 10] and other guidance should be \\nconsulted for the assessment of equipment designs or specific operations. \\n\\n2.10  On civilian sites, responsibilities for ensuring the security and safeguards of \\n\\nnuclear material are regulated by ONR Civil Nuclear Security and Safeguards \\n(CNSS) Division1. \\n\\n3. \\n\\nRELATIONSHIP TO LICENCE AND OTHER RELEVANT LEGISLATION \\n\\n3.1 \\n\\nExplicit reference to nuclear matter is found in LC 4 and 5. \\n\\nLC 4 is concerned with the necessity of “adequate arrangements” for bringing \\nnuclear matter onto a licensed site and for its storage there. Arrangements \\ncovering issues addressed by the relevant SAPs and this guidance should be \\nconsistent with any relevant information in a Safety Case, and the advice herein \\nwill be useful in addressing such arrangements as well as other relevant \\naspects of safety cases as a whole. \\n\\nLC 5 is concerned with the regulatory control of consignments from a licensed \\nsite and the records required to be kept. Its main purpose is to ensure that \\nHSE/ONR can identify destination sites for which a new licence might be \\nneeded. \\n\\n2.8 \\n\\n2.9 \\n\\n3.2 \\n\\n3.3 \\n\\n                                                 \\n1 Subject to the final position post-Brexit the period of shadow regulation may continue for a period. \\n\\nReport  NS-TAST-GD-023 \\nCM9 Ref: 2019/0250250 \\n\\nPage 3 of 14 \\n\\nOFFICIAL \\n \\n\\n\\x0cOffice for Nuclear Regulation  \\n \\n \\n\\n3.4 \\n\\n3.5 \\n\\n4.1 \\n\\n4.2 \\n\\n4.3 \\n\\nOFFICIAL \\n\\nOther laws and regulations affecting nuclear installations define the materials \\nwithin their scope in slightly different ways. The appendix to this guide expands \\non the definitions. Since all the legislation described in the appendix requires \\nsome control over radioactive/nuclear material, this guidance is relevant to all \\nnuclear legislation in varying degrees. \\n\\nLC 34 requires that licensees ensure, so far as is reasonably practicable, that \\nradioactive material and radioactive waste on the site is at all times controlled \\nor contained so that it cannot leak or otherwise escape. Assessment of \\narrangements to comply with this licence condition should therefore also take \\naccount of this guidance. Arrangements made under LCs 23 and 27 on \\noperating rules and safety mechanisms may also be relevant in this respect. \\nArrangements for the periodic review of safety cases under LC 15 will also be \\nrelevant as such reviews should address aspects of control and containment, \\nshortfalls against modern standards and the relevant overall site strategies for \\nthe control of nuclear matter. \\n\\n3.6 \\n\\nAs described in section 2 above, qualifying nuclear material for safeguards \\npurposes may also be nuclear matter, as such, the views of ONR Safeguards \\nshould be sought wherever it is appropriate to do so. \\n\\n4. \\n\\nRELATIONSHIP TO SAPS, WENRA REFERENCE LEVELS AND IAEA \\nSAFETY STANDARDS ADDRESSED \\n\\nSAPS \\nThis TAG provides guidance on SAPs ENM.1 to ENM.8 and their relationship \\nwith other parts of the SAPs.  The SAPs in the ENM section specify control at \\nincreasing levels of detail, starting at ENM.1 (highest level) with planning and \\nthe management strategy for the site. ENM.2 then covers facilities and their \\nsafety cases, ENM.3 covers the design, implementation and operation of those \\nfacilities and ENM.4 covers the administration of those operations. The \\ndesirable attributes of material in facilities are defined in principles ENM.5 and \\n6. Finally, principles ENM.7 and ENM.8 are concerned with retrieval/inspection \\nand accountancy of nuclear material. \\n\\nAdditional applications of this guidance include: fuel handling on research \\nreactors, waste handling on power reactors and reprocessing activities. Nuclear \\nmatter is subject to specific controls whilst in the core of a reactor [SAP ERC]. \\nReactor coolant must also be controlled to prevent damage to the core [SAP \\nEHT, ERC.3 and ESS para 340]. SAPs ENM.2-8 also apply to radioactive \\nwaste and contaminated land where they present an equivalent hazard. For \\nthese materials, principles in the sections on radioactive waste management \\n[RW.1 to 7] and contaminated land also apply [RL.1 to 8].  \\n\\nWestern  European  Nuclear  Regulators  Association  (WENRA)  Reference \\nlevels \\nThere are no specific WENRA reference levels relevant to this TAG, although \\nthose under Appendix E of the report of the Reactor Harmonisation Working \\nGroup on the Design Basis Envelope for Existing Reactors [5] are relevant to \\nthe associated engineering design provisions. The reference levels for Waste \\nand Spent Fuel Storage are explicitly addressed in other TAGs (NS-TAST-GD-\\n024 and NS-TAST-GD-081) but the advice given in this TAG is consistent with \\nthis position. \\n\\n4.4 \\n\\nIAEA Standards \\nThe concept of control in IAEA safety standards and guides covers all \\nregulated radioactive material and not just nuclear material, but in general the \\n\\nReport  NS-TAST-GD-023 \\nCM9 Ref: 2019/0250250 \\n\\nPage 4 of 14 \\n\\nOFFICIAL \\n \\n\\n\\x0cOffice for Nuclear Regulation  \\n \\n \\n\\nOFFICIAL \\n\\ncontrol of materials necessary for safety is not made explicitly in most IAEA \\ndocuments. The Requirements Document on the Safety of Fuel Cycle Facilities \\n[6] sets out relevant engineering design requirements and the Safety Guide \\nwhich covers fire protection [7], provides relevant guidance where a failure to \\ncontrol may lead to a fire or explosion hazard. \\n\\n5. \\n\\nADVICE TO INSPECTORS \\n\\n5.1 \\n\\n5.2 \\n\\n5.3 \\n\\n5.4 \\n\\nOverall strategy \\nENM.1 states that a strategy should exist, to ensure that unwanted material is \\nnot generated and that matter is controlled to prevent harm and to ensure \\ncontrol can be maintained. The strategy should be consistent with current \\nGovernment policy (such as Cmd. Paper 2919 and ref [8]) on such matters and \\ncomply with relevant statutory and applicable provisions, including relevant \\nLicence Conditions as outlined above. The strategy should be compatible with \\nindividual safety cases and take a holistic view, especially with regard to \\ninherent safety [EKP.1] [1]. The strategy should identify all routes for nuclear \\nmaterial both into and out of the site or facility. The latter should also comply \\nwith relevant legislation for transfers and disposals (the latter regulated by the \\nEA and SEPA, see Annex 1 to the SAPs). The strategy should cover all \\nrelevant nuclear material irrespective of whether it has been declared to be \\nnuclear waste. \\n\\nThe strategy will take account of the lifetimes of plant and requirements for \\ncontrol consistent with safety cases. The strategy or safety cases should \\ndemonstrate any prolonged storage is safer than disposal, where a disposal \\nroute is available. In some circumstances, the radioactive matter will present a \\nhazard long after the current facilities have reached the end of their useful life. \\nThe strategy should deal with this possibility and include appropriate \\ncognisance of requirements during the “period of responsibility” [9] which may \\napply long after a site or facility ceases normal operations. Finally, strategy \\ndocuments should be live documents, taking account of changes to \\ncircumstances. The following guidelines, together with other relevant SAPs \\n[e.g. SC.6, DC.1 to 9], can be used in assessing this strategy. Some radioactive \\nwaste is also nuclear matter and the principles in the SAPs sub-sections on \\nRadioactive Waste and Contaminated Land could also be relevant.  \\n\\nManagement Control \\nSAP ENM.2 covers control at the level of organisational control over activities \\non a nuclear licensed site by a combination of engineered systems and \\nmanagerial control procedures. The control will be justified in safety cases for \\nall the relevant operations on the site, which define the safe operating envelope \\nfor the material. \\n\\nAll activities involving nuclear matter are included and ENM.2 is not just \\nrestricted to the processing of nuclear matter. Control must be exercised when \\nraw nuclear materials or intermediates are stored or moved on a site, while \\nnuclear material is being processed and after treatment, prior to transport off-\\nsite for further treatment or disposal. There is no distinction between the \\nstandards of control required for radioactive feedstock or radioactive waste. \\nThe level of control will be related to the hazard, reliability demanded and the \\nconsequences of loss of control of any such material on workers and others. \\n\\n5.5 \\n\\nIn order to control processes involving hazardous substances it is necessary to \\nunderstand the objectives of the process, the limits and conditions required to \\nmaintain safety and the physical and chemical properties of the substances \\nbeing processed. \\n\\nReport  NS-TAST-GD-023 \\nCM9 Ref: 2019/0250250 \\n\\nPage 5 of 14 \\n\\nOFFICIAL \\n \\n\\n\\x0cOffice for Nuclear Regulation  \\n \\n \\n\\n5.6 \\n\\n5.7 \\n\\n \\n5.8 \\n\\n5.9 \\n\\nOFFICIAL \\n\\nThe need for control should be identified early in the safety case [particularly \\nSC.3] and the SAPs specifically demand identification of faults leading to loss \\nof control [FA.2]. \\n\\nThe safety case should review the options for process selection; to eliminate \\nhazards by minimising the inventory [SAP EKP.1 & Para 152] or prevention \\n(i.e. minimisation or reduction of the frequency of the fault) or by mitigation of \\nthe consequences, in order of preference. This should be clearly identified in \\nthe options studies that are carried out at the time of process selection and \\nshould form part of the safety justification, usually at the preliminary stage. The \\neffects of scale-up from experiments or different conditions during operation of \\nearlier plant should be allowed for. There should be adequate provision to \\nensure that under normal and fault conditions nuclear matter is: \\n\\n\\uf0b7  Cooled,  monitored  and  controlled  where  the  heat  from  radioactive  decay  or \\n\\nchemical reaction may be significant;  \\n\\n\\uf0b7  Managed  so  that  chemical  reactions,  radiolysis,  precipitation,  acidity  etc.  are \\n\\nkept within the specified limits (see ECH.1 – ECH.4); \\n\\n\\uf0b7  Segregated appropriately [see ENM.5]. \\n\\nThe safety case should be developed (see [10]) through a structured analysis \\n[SAP FA.2, EKP.4] including fault studies supported by probabilistic safety \\nanalysis where appropriate, see ONR guidance [11] on “Deterministic Safety \\nAnalysis and the Use of Engineering Principles in Safety Assessment”.  \\n\\nThe safety case should clearly identify the operating parameters [SAP-\\nSC.6] which define the operating envelope and safety significant parameters \\nwhich define the (LC 23) safety envelope and how each is derived; other ONR \\nguidance applies. Specific consideration should be given to process transients \\ndue to start-up, shutdown, maintenance and foreseeable faults [FA.6]. This is to \\nensure that conditions during such phases are adequately covered by the \\ncontrol / safety system or administrative procedures. Such consideration may \\nindicate the requirement for additional control during these phases. \\n\\n5.10  Although the preference would be for passive then engineered control at all \\n\\ntimes, where this is not reasonably practicable, administrative safety measures \\nmay suffice, see EKP.5. \\n\\n5.11 \\n\\nControl Features of Plant \\nInventories should be low enough to avoid adverse effects due to runaway \\nreactions and buffer storage should be sufficient to eliminate process \\nperturbations with safety implications, as recognised by ENM.2. Buffer storage \\nthat reduces sensitivity to faults should not be used for the prolonged storage of \\nnuclear matter and its inventory of potentially harmful materials should be \\nminimised consistent with the required functionality. There is a balance \\nbetween achieving a robust process and minimising the inventory in buffer \\nstorage. \\n\\n5.12  The site arrangements, layout and plant design should aim to avoid \\n\\nunnecessary movements of nuclear matter [EKP.3 and ELO.3] \\n\\n5.13  Occasions when it is necessary to temporarily re-route nuclear matter include \\n\\npressure relief and sampling. Continuous monitoring instrumentation may \\nprovide necessary data but in certain circumstances samples of the actual \\nmaterial may have to be taken. \\n\\nReport  NS-TAST-GD-023 \\nCM9 Ref: 2019/0250250 \\n\\nPage 6 of 14 \\n\\nOFFICIAL \\n \\n\\n\\x0cOffice for Nuclear Regulation  \\n \\n \\n\\n5.14  Monitoring of plant parameters should rely as far as is practicable on \\n\\ninstrumentation that does not require nuclear matter to be diverted outside the \\nmain containment. \\n\\nOFFICIAL \\n\\n5.15 \\n\\nIf samples are needed, adequate consideration should be given to ensuring \\nthat samples are representative of the process to allow accurate measurement \\n(ECH.4), whether or not routine control depends on the on-line or the off-line \\ninstruments. Account should be taken of potential problems due to phase \\nseparation, sample line deposition, condensation from gas streams, blockages, \\ntemperature and chemical changes, which may affect the composition of the \\nsample being taken. \\n\\n5.16  Where material must be re-routed, provision should be made to ensure the safe \\n\\nhandling of the material [ECV.3 and 4] and its return to safe containment by: \\n\\n1  Return to the process after use, or \\n\\n2  Treatment, or \\n\\n3  Storage, or \\n\\n4  Disposal. \\n\\n5.17  Whilst sampling should be avoided as a means for controlling dynamic \\n\\nsystems, it may still be necessary to periodically retrieve smaller amounts of \\nmaterial over a longer timescale, in order to demonstrate compliance with a \\nsafety case. Whilst ENM.3 discourages sampling as a means of controlling \\ndynamic processes, ENM.7 is a reminder that some sampling from longer-term \\nstorage may be necessary. \\n\\n5.18  Facilities should be designed in a way that facilitates bulk recovery of material \\nbefore they reach the end of their operational or design life or earlier if required \\nby site strategies [e.g.: ENM.1 & RW.1]. ENM.7 states that facilities should be \\ndesigned and operated so that material can be retrieved within an appropriate \\nperiod of time, including intervention in the event of unexpected faults, \\naccidents or degradation of packaging. (See also SAP-RW.5.) \\n\\n5.19  The scope of SAP ENM.3 is broad; including not only systems for materials \\n\\naccountancy but also the design and operation of the facilities that control \\nnuclear matter. Essentially, it builds on ENM.2 by considering the systems \\nneeded to provide control. \\n\\n5.20 \\n\\nIn some cases, adequate control may depend on the use of robust and \\nauditable operating instructions and procedures.  Accountancy measurements \\nmay provide further support. There is ONR guidance [12] on centralised \\nsystems to monitor materials movements and process conditions. \\n\\n5.21  The fundamental principles SAP EKP.1 to 5 are relevant to design and \\n\\noperation of processes controlling nuclear matter. ONR expects systems \\nproviding safety functions to possess appropriate levels of redundancy, \\ndiversity and segregation from systems used for normal control [EDR.2], see \\nONR guidance on functional safety systems [12].  It should be shown that \\nsafety-related components can be operated and controlled within a safe \\noperating envelope throughout their operating life. The parameters of the \\nenvelope should be consistent with the type of construction, potential modes of \\nfailure and operational considerations. \\n\\n5.22  Monitoring and recording systems are necessary to detect problems that may \\ndevelop in processes due to leakage, changes in temperature, chemical \\n\\nReport  NS-TAST-GD-023 \\nCM9 Ref: 2019/0250250 \\n\\nPage 7 of 14 \\n\\nOFFICIAL \\n \\n\\n\\x0cOffice for Nuclear Regulation  \\n \\n \\n\\nOFFICIAL \\n\\nreaction and other effects.  The ESR and ESS sections of SAPs expand on the \\nrequirements for these systems. As well as leakage, effects including \\nsegregation, deposition and condensation can cause problems, see ENM.8. \\n\\n5.23  Where practicable, safety systems, safety-related instrumentation and \\n\\nengineered controls should be designed to fail-safe. Failure should be revealed \\nto the operator by alarms or other means. There may be a requirement for high \\nlevels of redundancy and diversity dependent on the reliability of each system. \\nThe problems associated with single failure criteria should be considered \\n[EDR.4]. \\n\\n5.24  The maintenance requirements of any monitoring and control equipment should \\n\\nbe clearly identified [LC28] and in accordance with the arrangements made \\nunder the licence conditions. These should include calibration and ensure that \\nthe control system is always available when required. Similar maintenance is \\nrequired for safety systems and safety related instrumentation [13] and this is \\naddressed by ONR guidance. \\n\\nAttributes of Nuclear Material \\n\\n5.25  ENM.5 and 6 outline physical and chemical characteristics that nuclear material \\nshould possess, for control to be achievable. Together with the process \\ncharacteristics, these determine the precautions that need to be taken to \\nensure adequate control arrangements are in place. These should be \\ndocumented e.g.: in flowsheets, safety functional requirements and the basis of \\ndesign. These documents should be identified in the safety case. Such \\ninformation will help to define the safety envelope within which the process is \\nmanaged. \\n\\n5.26 \\n\\nIn some circumstances the identification and quantification of the materials \\nbeing handled may not be possible. When this is the case, the arrangements \\nshould allow for the level of uncertainty and identify additional levels of control \\nto maintain safety margins as required by the safety analysis. \\n\\n5.27  Arrangements should be made and implemented (which may include \\n\\nexamination, testing and auditing) to ensure that incoming material meets the \\nacceptance criteria.  Arrangements should also be established for the safe \\nmanagement of any incoming material that fails to meet the acceptance criteria.  \\n\\n5.28  Segregation in SAP paragraph 789 includes segregation both from \\n\\nincompatible materials and according to physical and chemical form, \\nflammability, specific radioactivity, half-life, fissile nature and type of radiation \\nemitted where subsequent storage, processing, conditioning and disposal \\nwould otherwise be adversely affected. \\n\\n5.29  Passively safe conditions for storage should be used where reasonably \\n\\npracticable. Storage of material in a passively safe state still requires a safety \\ncase that identifies operational limits and conditions required for safety. Many of \\nthe paragraphs in SAP RW.5 also apply to ENM.6 and 7 for nuclear material. \\nWhere fissile material is present, no external controls should be relied upon to \\nprevent criticality, see ECR.1 and ECR.2.  The safety case should demonstrate \\nacceptable sub-criticality margins for stores taking account of the uncertainties \\nthat may exist. Relevant factors may include: \\n\\n\\uf0b7 \\n\\n\\uf0b7 \\n\\nform of the material; \\n\\nenvironmental  conditions, \\ncontaminants; \\n\\nOFFICIAL \\n \\n\\nincluding \\n\\ntemperature,  humidity,  and \\n\\nReport  NS-TAST-GD-023 \\nCM9 Ref: 2019/0250250 \\n\\nPage 8 of 14 \\n\\n\\x0cOffice for Nuclear Regulation  \\n \\n \\n\\n\\uf0b7 \\n\\n\\uf0b7 \\n\\n\\uf0b7 \\n\\n \\n\\n5.30 \\n\\nheat generation (from individual items and the whole store); \\n\\nOFFICIAL \\n\\ngas generation (pressurisation, flammable mixtures, deformation); and \\n\\nradiological  hazards,  taking  account  of  on-site  storage  and  long  term \\nmanagement, which may include disposal. \\n\\nIn some circumstances, the inherent safety characteristics of the process \\nreduce the potential hazard such that the control arrangements can be \\nappropriately simplified. \\n\\nAccountancy & Display Systems \\n\\n5.31  Principle ENM.4 expects records of nuclear matter to be generated and kept, \\n\\nthis is also a fundamental Safeguards requirement in the case of qualifying \\nnuclear material. ENM.8 requires this information to be processed and \\nanalysed in a timely manner in order to prevent any significant deviations from \\nenvironmental, security or safety case criteria. \\n\\n5.32  The arrangements for monitoring and relaying control and safety information to \\n\\nrelevant staff should be clearly identified in the safety case. Thus the safety \\ncase should specify the periodicity of gathering and displaying such data. \\nDisplay systems should be configured to provide an overview of the condition of \\nthe process including, where appropriate, mass and volumetric balance \\nsummaries. \\n\\n5.33  Where plant safety must be maintained by appropriate and timely response to \\n\\nsystem alarms [EHF.7], the response should be automatic where reasonably \\npracticable; however, where it is not, proportionate robust managerial control \\nshould be exercised. \\n\\n5.34  The actions to be taken on failure of safety systems, safety related \\n\\ninstrumentation and engineered control equipment should be clearly identified \\nin the safety case and in instructions to workers. This advice should be \\nincorporated in any on-site, off-site emergency or contingency instructions. In \\nsome circumstances the safety case may have to consider the need for local \\nfield control stations for normal control and in the event that the main control \\ncentre is not tenable. \\n\\nReport  NS-TAST-GD-023 \\nCM9 Ref: 2019/0250250 \\n\\nPage 9 of 14 \\n\\nOFFICIAL \\n \\n\\n\\x0cOffice for Nuclear Regulation  \\n \\n \\n\\n6. \\n\\nREFERENCES \\n\\n \\n\\nOFFICIAL \\n\\n1.

To  avoid  over-regulation  in  areas  where \\nparliament did not intend, the legislation also specifies a number of exceptions \\nto  terms  such  as  nuclear  matter.  Whilst  this  may  seem  complicated,  such \\ndifferences  rarely  impact  on  the  work  of  nuclear  inspection  because  there  is \\nconsiderable  consistency \\nthe  main \\ndistinguishing features and exceptions to the legislation. \\n\\nin  practice.

The  NIA \\ndefines its subject matter as: \\n\\nSubject to any exceptions prescribed in NIA and the Nuclear Installations \\n(Excepted Matter) Regulations 2017, nuclear matter is: \\n\\nany  fissile  material  in  the  form  of  uranium  metal,  alloy  or  chemical \\ncompound  (including  natural  uranium),  or  of  plutonium  metal,  alloy  or \\nchemical  compound,  and  any  other  fissile  material  which  may  be \\nprescribed; and \\n\\nany radioactive material produced in, or made radioactive by exposure to \\nthe radiation incidental to, the process of producing or utilising any such \\nfissile material as aforesaid. \\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\nA1.5 \\n\\nIn the NIA, “excepted matter” means nuclear matter consisting only of one or \\nmore of the following, that is to say: \\n\\nisotopes  prepared  for  use  for  industrial,  commercial,  agricultural, \\nmedical [scientific or educational] purposes; \\n\\nnatural uranium; \\n\\nany uranium in which the isotope 235 forms not more than 0.72%; \\n\\nnuclear  matter  of  such  other  description, \\nin  such \\ncircumstances  as  may  be  prescribed  (or,  for  the  purposes  of  the \\napplication  of  this  Act  to  a  relevant  foreign  operator,  as  may  be \\nexcluded \\ninternational \\nagreement by the relevant foreign law). \\n\\nthe  operation  of \\n\\nthe  relevant \\n\\nif  any, \\n\\nfrom \\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\nA1.6  Excepted  matter  is  nuclear  matter.  The  Excepted  Matter  Regulations  provide \\ncertain exemptions which apply outside of nuclear licensed sites. For definitions \\nof  terms  such  as  “relevant  foreign  operator”,  “radiation  practice”  etc., \\ninspectors are referred to the source legislation. \\n\\nA1.7  The  definition  of  “Radioactive  Substance” \\n\\nin \\n\\nthe \\n\\nIonising  Radiation \\n\\nRegulations (2017) is a much broader term than “Nuclear Matter”. \\n\\nA1.8        Under  IRR17,  where  a  radioactive  substance  is  used  in  a  practice,  (where  a \\npractice  means  work  involving  the  production,  processing,  handling,  disposal, \\nuse, storage, holding or transport of radioactive substances), its activity should \\nnever be disregarded for the purposes of radiation protection where the activity \\nconcentrations exceed specified values as defined in the regulations.  If further \\ninformation is required regarding the interpretation of IRR17, please refer to an \\nONR radiation protection specialist inspector. \\n\\nA1.9  The  term  “sealed  source”  means  a  source  containing  any  radioactive \\nsubstance  whose  structure  is  such  as  to  prevent,  under  normal  conditions  of \\nuse, any dispersion of radioactive substances into the environment, but it does \\nnot  include  any  radioactive  substance  inside  a  nuclear  reactor  or  any  nuclear \\nfuel element. \\n\\nA1.10  Nuclear Safeguards legislation defines nuclear material as fissionable material, \\nsource material or ore.  Source material means material containing the mixture \\nof isotopes occurring in nature.  \\n\\nA1.11  Nuclear  matter,  as  defined  in  the  NI  Act  covers  a  subset  of  radioactive \\nmaterial  as  defined  by  the  RSA,  or  radioactive  substance  as  defined  in \\nIRR17.  The  environmental  legislation  (EPR  2016  and  EASR  2018)  makes  a \\nclear distinction between radioactive material and radioactive waste.
