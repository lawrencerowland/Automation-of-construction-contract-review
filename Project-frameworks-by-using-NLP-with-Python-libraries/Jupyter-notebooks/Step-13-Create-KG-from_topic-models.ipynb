    " Step 12 has identified two topics, each characterised by certain words. Now we use the knowledge graph to understand the business domain covered by the document library we are looking at. In consultation with the portfolio stakeholders, and domain experts, we can modify the knowledge-graph to reflect a sensible way of handling the business domain. \n",

    "The immediate output is either:\n",
