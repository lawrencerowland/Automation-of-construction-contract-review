A rapt Jake stunned the audience with an astute question about Mars’ moons, and on the drive home, couldn’t stop talking about the solar system. Jake “hadn’t been missing after all,” she realized, just because he was unreachable. Unhindered, he had been busy working: His repetitive behavior, much as some autism researchers have speculated, reflected detail-oriented curiosity rather than being merely a self-soothing habit. “Rage to master” was a relevant phrase coined by another psychologist, Ellen Winner, who concluded that a fiercely self-propelled drive was what set a true prodigy apart from a super-industrious high-achiever. “Nobody was telling Jake how to learn,” Kristine wrote, “because nobody thought he could. In that way, autism had given Jake a bizarre gift.”\"\n",

Homeostasis in good or even optimal ranges expresses itself as well-being and even joy, while the happiness caused by love and friendship contributes to more efficient homeostasis and promotes health. The negative examples are just as clear. The stress associated with sadness is caused by calling into action the hypothalamus and the pituitary gland and by releasing molecules whose consequence is reducing homeostasis and actually damaging countless body parts such as blood vessels and muscular structures. Interestingly, the homeostatic burden of physical disease can activate the same hypothalamic-pituitary axis and cause release of dynorphin, a molecule that induces dysphoria.\"\n",

The breadth refers to all of the external things regarding the concept, spanning its extensions or denotations, the things to which it connects. The depth applies to the intensions or comprehension about the concept, what it is, including internal properties or qualities. Peirce preferred extension v comprehension when referring to these two respective ideas. Peirce uses these terms in their absolute senses. That is, for a given thought or concept at hand\"\n",

I continued journeying for four days, my daily journeys varying from twenty to twenty-five miles. During this time nothing occurred to me worthy of any especial notice.

Feeling hungry, I entered a decent-looking inn—within a kind of bar I saw a huge, fat, landlord-looking person, with a very pretty, smartly-dressed maiden. Addressing myself to the fat man, \"\"House!\"\" said I, \"\"house! Can I have dinner, house?\"\" \"\"Young gentleman,\"\" said the huge fat landlord, \"\"you are come at the right time; dinner will be taken up in a few minutes, and such a dinner,\"\" he continued, rubbing his hands, \"\"as you will not see every day in these times.\"\"\n",
