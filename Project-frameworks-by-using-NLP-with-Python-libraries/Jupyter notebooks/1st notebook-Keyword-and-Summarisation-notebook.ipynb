    "# Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "Projects have different business and function aspects. These notebooks can be used to run simple code on a set of pdf and text files that the user has collected for their particular business domain. \n",
    "\n",
    "Below is basic code that can be applied directly to  any portfolio documents. Here this code is worked through with an example of understanding the implications of the regulatory environment on project delivery in the nuclear sector.This can be replaced as the user generates her own results. \n",
    "\n",
    "For simplicity, this one starts from documents as text files and internet pages. Additional features can be sought in the other notebooks once first results have been generated for your portfolio documents. \n",
    "\n",
    "# Features\n",
    "- Summarises each document\n",
    "- finds keywords for each document\n",
    "- creates a similarity-search: for any new paragraph, it finds the most similar documents from the library\n",
    "- (propose a data-model for the portfolio, based upon these findings) ***(Status: incomplete)***\n",
    "\n",
    "# Prerequisites \n",
    "\n",
    "The following Python libraries are needed: Gensim, BS4. Also NLTK and SpaCy. Gensim requires NumPy and SciPy. NLTK requires Pandas.\n",

      "INTRODUCTION 1.1 1.2 1.3 1.4 2.1 3.1 This Technical Assessment Guide (TAG) represents specific guidance for ONR inspectors on what they should expect of a nuclear licensee or dutyholder1 in meeting its legal requirement to reduce risks so far as is reasonably practicable (SFAIRP).\n",
      "In other cases, either where standards and relevant good practice are less evident or not fully applicable, the onus is on the licensee to implement measures to the point where the costs of any additional measures (in terms of money, time or trouble – the sacrifice) would be grossly disproportionate to the further risk reduction that would be achieved (the safety benefit).\n",
      "5.4 The following represent principles which are likely to need addressing in most cases: 1 The application of ALARP can only be to risks which the licensee controls (e.g. it is not a requirement for nuclear power plant operators to consider other forms of electrical generation).\n",
      "Based on HSE [4], relevant good practice is \"… those standards for controlling risk which have been judged and recognised by HSE as satisfying the law when applied to a particular relevant case in an appropriate manner.\" In nuclear safety applications, where the potential consequences of accidents can be very serious, the best practice identified as appropriate to the application would normally be required for new designs.\n",
      "Subsequent regulatory experience (since TOR) suggests there would be little benefit in ONR developing such a “rule book” in view of the types of safety case arguments we normally see and the overriding need for licensees to consider relevant good practice as the starting point for their risk assessments. \n",

PURPOSE AND SCOPE The purpose of this Technical Assessment Guide (TAG) is to assist in making informed judgements and decisions on the adequacy of the licensee’s arrangements and their implementation, to ensure that changes to organisational structure or resources which may affect safety are adequately controlled in accordance with the requirement of nuclear site licence condition (LC) 36 ‘Organisational Capability’ as set out in Appendix Appendix 4 of this TAG also provides guidance on how Inspectors should approach the revised clause in LC 36(1), added in 2011, which requires licensees to provide and maintain adequate financial and human resources to fulfil their obligations in respect of nuclear safety.\n",
      "5.32 The inspector should consider whether or not:    The licensee has formal, documented management of change arrangements which are an integral part of its management system; It is clear that the arrangements apply to all aspects of the licensee’s activities, including changes at Board or Executive team level, that have the potential to affect nuclear safety, and have they been promulgated to all parts of the licensee’s organisation; The documented arrangements are clear, available to end users and up to date;  The arrangements use a methodology which is easy to understand and follow; Report : NS-TAST-GD-048 Revision 5 TRIM Ref: 2018/283567 Page 9 of 25 Office for Nuclear Regulation       The methodology is being consistently interpreted and applied across the licensee organisation; Roles and responsibilities for implementing the management of change arrangements are clearly defined, integrated with the management system and understood by staff with management of change process roles; SQEP requirements for staff fulfilling key roles within the arrangements are clearly defined; Staff fulfilling key management of change arrangements are demonstrably SQEP for those roles and they have a suitable level of authority within the licensee’s organisation; All change proposals are logged in a change register and records are available to substantiate the key decisions made in support of significant changes in accordance with the licensee’s arrangements for LC 6; The arrangements are subject to the processes of independent review and audit operated by the licensee.\n",
      "Report : NS-TAST-GD-048 Revision 5 TRIM Ref: 2018/283567 Page 13 of 25 Office for Nuclear Regulation 5.55 The inspector should consider whether or not:           An initial screening assessment has been prepared to identify the potential impact of the change proposal on nuclear safety significance and categorise the proposal; The risk assessment uses a clear, consistent and well-informed approach which identifies potential risks arising both from the final outcome of the change and the process of transition; The classification methodology is easy to understand and is being applied objectively and consistently, throughout the licensee’s organisation; There is a checking process to confirm that changes have been correctly categorised and challenged by a SQEP; Safeguards are in place to avoid under-categorisation of changes or ‘salami slicing’; The licensee’s arrangements identify, and meet ONR’s expectations for, the need to communicate Category 1 and 2 change proposals to ONR and include a derived power which will allow ONR to provide formal agreement to change proposals as set out in the bullet points in paragraph 5.16; The licensee’s arrangements encourage authors of change proposals to make provision for timely engagement with ONR. \n",

      "In addition, it should be noted that PSA covers a whole range of disciplines and, therefore, PSA assessment requires involvement of inspectors with in-depth expertise in a range of areas such as fault studies and thermal-hydraulic analysis, mechanical, electrical and C&I systems, civil engineering, human factors, software reliability, structural integrity, internal and external hazards, severe accident and radiation safety.\n",
      "Report : NS-TAST-GD-030 CM9 Ref: 2018/408246 Page 3 of 81 Office for Nuclear Regulation 4.2 Fault analysis: general – Design basis analysis, PSA and severe accident analysis – FA.1 “Fault analysis should be carried out comprising suitable and sufficient design basis analysis, PSA and severe accident analysis to demonstrate that risks are ALARP” This principle outlines the inter-relationship between the three types of fault analysis, DBA, PSA and SAA and how in combination they address the range of potential initiating events (IEs) with nuclear safety significance off the site.\n",
      "In addition, in order to meet this principle, the PSA should be kept living, i.e. it should be updated as necessary to reflect the current design and operational features and to Report : NS-TAST-GD-030 CM9 Ref: 2018/408246 Page 4 of 81 Office for Nuclear Regulation incorporate feedback from internal and external operational experience, improved understanding of physical processes or accident progression and advances in modelling techniques.\n",
      "2) PSA Models PSA should account for all contributions to the risk, including, but not necessarily restricted to: random component individual failures, components which are failed by the IE, common cause failures (CCFs) (and, as necessary, other dependent and consequential failures), unavailabilities due to testing and maintenance, pre-initiating event human errors (e.g., misalignments and mis-calibrations), human errors that lead to IEs and human errors during the course of the accident sequences (including misdiagnosis, decision errors, omission errors and commission errors).\n",
      "Any issue that is going to be evaluated using PSA (e.g. a facility design or operational feature, a proposed change to the design, or an event at the facility) should be explicitly defined together with the type of results required as input to the decision-making, including any numerical criteria that need to be met.\n",
      "4.10 Fault analysis: assurance of validity of data and models – Use of data – AV.3 Report : NS-TAST-GD-030 CM9 Ref: 2018/408246 Page 10 of 81 Office for Nuclear Regulation “The data used in the analysis of aspects of plant performance with safety significance should be shown to be valid for the circumstances by reference to established physical data, experiment or other appropriate means” Failure rate and probability data is the basis of the PSA; therefore, for the PSA to be an adequate representation of the facility, it should make use of data that can be demonstrated to be valid for the facility.\n",
      "If the sensitivity analyses performed do not provide sufficient confidence in the validity of the conclusions of the PSA, reasonably practicable steps need to be taken to reduce the uncertainties associated with the model and data – this may include use of independent methods and computer codes, where appropriate, as indicated in the text accompanying SAP AV.6.\n",
      "4.14 Fault analysis: assurance of validity of data and models – Data collection – AV.7 “Data should be collected throughout the operating life of the facility to check or update the safety analysis” The validity and applicability of the IE frequencies, component failure probabilities, unavailabilities, etc, used in the PSA can only be assured if these are reviewed periodically using facility specific information.\n",
      "Since much of the guidance provided in Appendix 1 can also be applied to other types of facilities, inspectors may wish to use Appendix 1 at their discretion for the assessment of PSAs for facilities other than NPPs. 1) PSA should be a systematic analysis to identify all important fault sequences which can lead to radiological consequences and to evaluate their contribution to the level of risk represented by the facility.\n",
      "3) Specific assessment expectations for review of the adequacy and completeness of the list of IEs considered in the PSAs for NPPs can be found in Tables A1-2.1 (identification and grouping of initiating events), A1-2.7 (analysis of hazards) and A1- 2.8 (low power and shutdown modes) of Appendix 1.\n",
      "Report : NS-TAST-GD-030 CM9 Ref: 2018/408246 Page 16 of 81 Office for Nuclear Regulation 5.6 Accident Sequence Analysis 1) The next stage of the PSA is the accident sequence analysis which models the behaviour of the facility for the IEs. The analysis should cover all possible combinations of success or failure of the protection systems to perform the safety functions and should identify the accident sequences which involve failure to maintain the facility within safe limits.\n",
      "5.14 Quantification of the Analysis Report : NS-TAST-GD-030 CM9 Ref: 2018/408246 Page 21 of 81 Office for Nuclear Regulation 1) The PSA should determine the combinations of basic events such as component failure, CCF, operator error and plant unavailability which lead to the fault sequence and determine its frequency of occurrence.\n",
      "Nevertheless, these risks need to be evaluated by the dutyholders in order to address the relevant numerical targets of the SAPs. A1-2 Not used Report : NS-TAST-GD-030 CM9 Ref: 2018/408246 Page 24 of 81 Office for Nuclear Regulation A1-3 Use of this Appendix A1-3.1 The Tables in this Appendix present check lists of items that inspectors should generally expect to see when assessing the different areas of the PSAs for nuclear reactors.\n",
