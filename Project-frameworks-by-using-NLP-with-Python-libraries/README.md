# Topic models for Project Frameworks using Python libraries

**[Purpose](#Purpose)** | **[Motivation](#Motivation)** |**[Quick start](#Quick-start)** |


# Purpose
Projects have different business and function aspects. 
These notebooks can be used to run simple code on a set of pdf and text files that the user has collected for their particular business domain. 

# Motivation
xx

# Quick-start

# Usage if using Conda

1. Install Miniconda

1. Create GENSIM_ENV environment with an appropriate Python version

1. Install Gensim dependencies. Currently these are NumPy then SciPy and then Gensim 

1. conda activate GENSIM_ENV . Then jupyter lab

(you may need to also activate the Env again once in Jupiter lab)

1. one to start with might be '2020 03 USEFUL version GENSIM pdf corpus at Document level to text summary keyword BOW TFIDF LSI cosine similarity.ipynb'  See here (xx) 

# Software requirements for the various notebooks**
the following Python libraries to be installed: Gensim, BS4. Also NLTK and SpaCy. Gensim requires NumPy and SciPy. NLTK requires Pandas.

# Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

# Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
