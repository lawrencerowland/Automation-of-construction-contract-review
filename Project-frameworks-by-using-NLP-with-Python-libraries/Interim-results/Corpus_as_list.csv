4.2 

The Office for Nuclear Regulation (ONR) has established a set of Security Assessment 
Principles (SyAPs) (Reference 7). This document contains Fundamental Security 
Principles (FSyPs) that dutyholders must demonstrate have been fully taken into 
account in developing their security arrangements to meet relevant legal obligations. 
The security regime for meeting these principles is described in security plans prepared 
by the dutyholders, which are approved by ONR under the Nuclear Industries Security 
Regulations (NISR) 2003 (Reference 1).  

The term ‘security plan’ is used to cover all dutyholder submissions such as nuclear site 
security plans, temporary security plans and transport security statements. NISR 
Regulation 22 dutyholders may also use the SyAPs as the basis for Cyber Security and 
Information Assurance documentation that helps them demonstrate ongoing legal 
compliance for the protection of Sensitive Nuclear Information (SNI). The SyAPs are 
supported by a suite of guides to assist ONR inspectors in their assessment and 
inspection work, and in making regulatory judgements and decisions.  This Technical 
Assessment Guidance (TAG) is such a guide. 

2. 

PURPOSE AND SCOPE 

This TAG contains guidance to advise and inform ONR inspectors in exercising their 
regulatory judgment during assessment activities relating to a dutyholder’s 
arrangements to ensure their security systems are subject to appropriate 
commissioning. It aims to provide general advice and guidance to ONR inspectors on 
how this aspect of security should be assessed. It does not set out how ONR regulates 
the dutyholder’s arrangements.  It does not prescribe the methodologies for dutyholders 
to follow in demonstrating they have addressed the SyAPs. It is the dutyholder’s 
responsibility to determine and describe this detail and for ONR to assess whether the 
arrangements are adequate.  

3. 

RELATIONSHIP TO LICENCE AND OTHER RELEVANT LEGISLATION 

The term ‘dutyholder’ mentioned throughout this guide is used to define ‘responsible 
persons’ on civil nuclear licensed sites and other nuclear premises subject to security 
regulation, a ‘developer’ carrying out work on a nuclear construction site and approved 
carriers, as defined in NISR. It is also used to refer to those holding SNI.  

NISR defines a ‘nuclear premises’ and requires ‘the responsible person’ as defined to 
have an approved security plan in accordance with Regulation 4. It further defines 
approved carriers and requires them to have an approved Transport Security Statement 
in accordance with Regulation 16. Persons to whom Regulation 22 applies are required 
to protect SNI. ONR considers supply chain management to be an important component 
of a dutyholder’s arrangements in demonstrating compliance with relevant legislation.   

4. 

RELATIONSHIP TO IAEA DOCUMENTATION AND GUIDANCE 

The essential elements of a national nuclear security regime are set out in the 
Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material (CPPNM) (Reference 4) and 
the IAEA Nuclear Security Fundamentals (Reference 3). Further guidance is available 
within IAEA Technical Guidance and Implementing Guides. 

Fundamental Principle J of the CPPNM refers to quality assurance and states that a 
quality assurance policy and quality assurance programmes should be established and 
implemented with a view to providing confidence that specified requirements for all 
activities important to physical protection are satisfied. The importance of issues relating

to quality assurance is also recognised in the Nuclear Security Fundamentals, 
specifically: 

 

Essential Element 12: Sustaining a Nuclear Security Regime – 3.12 A nuclear 
security regime ensures that each competent authority and authorised person 
and other organisations with nuclear security responsibilities contribute to the 
sustainability of the regime by: 

a)  Developing, implementing, and maintaining appropriate and effective 
integrated management systems including quality management 
systems; and, 

h)  Routinely performing assurance activities to identify and address 

issues and factors that may affect the capacity to provide adequate 
nuclear security, including cyber security, at all times.  

A more detailed description of the quality assurance is provided in Recommendations 
level guidance, specifically Nuclear Security Series (NSS) 13, Recommendations on 
Physical Protection of Nuclear Material and Nuclear Facilities (INFCIRC/225/Revision 5) 
(Reference 2). This document states “The quality assurance policy and programmes for 
physical protection should ensure that a physical protection system is designed, 
implemented, operated and maintained in a condition capable of effectively responding 
to the threat assessment or design basis threat and that it meets the State’s regulations, 
including its prescriptive and/or performance based requirements.” 

5. 

RELATIONSHIP TO NATIONAL POLICY DOCUMENTS 

The SyAPs provide ONR inspectors with a framework for making consistent regulatory 
judgements on the effectiveness of a dutyholder’s security arrangements.  This TAG 
provides guidance to ONR inspectors when assessing a dutyholder’s submission 
demonstrating they have effective processes in place to achieve SyDP 4.4 – 
Commissioning, in support of FSyP 4 – Nuclear Supply Chain Management.  The TAG 
is consistent with other TAGs and associated guidance and policy documentation. 

The HMG Security Policy Framework (SPF) (Reference 5) describes the Cabinet 
Secretary’s expectations of how HMG organisations and third parties handling HMG 
information and other assets will apply protective security to ensure HMG can function 
effectively, efficiently and securely. The security outcomes and requirements detailed in 
the SPF have been incorporated within the SyAPs. This ensures that dutyholders are 
presented with a coherent set of expectations for the protection of nuclear premises, 
SNI and the employment of appropriate personnel security controls both on and off 
nuclear premises. 

5.3 

The Classification Policy (Reference 6) indicates those categories of SNI, which require 
protection and the level of security classification to be applied. 

6. 

ADVICE TO INSPECTORS 

Commissioning is the activity of setting to work systems and associated infrastructure, 
including assuring all systems and components are designed, installed, tested, 
operated, and maintained according to the Operational Requirements (ORs) of the 
owner. A commissioning process may be applied to new projects and existing systems, 
subject to modifications or significant maintenance. The scale of the commissioning 
activity should be proportionate to the level of complexity and degree of impact that the 
project will have on the site or facility’s ability to meet its security outcome as defined in 
Annexes C and D of SyAPs.

OFFICIAL 

This TAG is aimed at providing guidance to the inspector when assessing the adequacy 
of the commissioning arrangements demonstrated through the performance of the 
equipment (and those personnel who will manage, operate and maintain it) and the 
adequacy of the procedures to support the operation of that equipment. As part of this 
process, early engagement with dutyholders is essential in order to fully understand 
their proposals, assess the quality and completeness of the activities and measure the 
compliance of the plant and systems with the Physical Protection System (PPS) 
outcome and postures. This engagement should have been on-going throughout the 
development of the project. The commissioning activity is the first opportunity to confirm 
the performance of the installation and its contribution to meeting relevant security 
objectives.  

6.3 

This TAG should also be used to consider circumstances when security equipment is 
being removed at a dutyholder’s site, when the site is being progressively being 
decommissioned. 

Regulatory Expectation 

6.4 

The regulatory expectation is that dutyholders demonstrate in the security plan how they 
implement proportionate commissioning plans which should include clear definition of 
roles and responsibilities, performance indicators, availability of resources and clearly 
defined decision points (to be met prior to moving to the next phase), as appropriate. 
Where the plant and systems form a part of an existing infrastructure, the inspector 
should expect to identify that a risk assessment has been undertaken to review the 
potential impact on security caused by the commissioning of the new (or refurbished) 
equipment. Planned mitigation of any associated risks should also be evidenced.

Commissioning 

SyDP 4.4 

Before bringing into operation or returning to service any facility, system or process 
that may affect security it should be subject to testing and a commissioning plan 
defined in the security plan.

7.3 

THE COMMISSIONING PROCESS 

Commissioning activity should be much more than simply setting plant and equipment to 
work. The effectiveness of security equipment to meet PPS postures and outcomes 
described in SyAPs, requires the integration of a wider range of assets to support the 
operation of security equipment. This may include uninterruptable and possibly 
alternative power supplies such as diesel generators, to secure reliable performance. 
Commissioning should provide evidence and demonstrate that all aspects of the wider 
infrastructure operate as planned in both normal and fault conditions to confirm 
operational resilience. 

Commissioning is typically broken into two parts usually termed ‘cold’ and ‘hot’ 
commissioning. The former usually demonstrates the completeness of the plant and 
systems. It confirms that all components are installed, connections made and plant 
labelled. Evidence should be available to show this process has been undertaken and 
appropriate ‘snagging’, to put things right, has been expedited. 

‘Hot’ commissioning refers to a phase when the plant and systems are energised. It is 
when the actual performance of the individual plant components is demonstrated

against their specified performance. This is followed by component integration into 
systems together with the human response elements.  The final combination of the 
different systems into the overall infrastructure should prove the overall effectiveness of 
the installation and whether it meets the intent and success criteria described in the 
ORs. 

Integral to this ‘hot’ commissioning phase is the record of commissioning activities. The 
inspector should expect comprehensive records to be kept of this phase of the 
programme. This captures the settings for plant components to deliver the system 
performance and may need to correlate with the ‘as tested’ settings in the case of 
Centre for the Protection of National Infrastructure approved security equipment for 
example. These base settings are important in confirming equipment remains fit for 
purpose and to enable straightforward fault finding and system re-commissioning later in 
its life. A package of information should be delivered which also includes a set of ‘as 
built’ drawings, operating and maintenance procedures and requirements, a 
recommended spares holding and other pertinent information. 

Commissioning plant represents the penultimate step towards operation. The inspector 
should seek evidence from the dutyholder that the original ORs are met throughout the 
different phases of commissioning. Evidence of any changes (and associated 
justifications to support them), should be available from the dutyholder. 

The introduction of new or revised security equipment and systems, impacts the 
approved security plan in that it represents a change to the approved arrangements. It 
would be expected that these changes are captured in any Security Improvement 
Schedule (SIS), itself a part of the approved security plan. 

The inspector should ensure that the dutyholder is preparing the appropriate submission 
to modify the security plan (and the SIS) in order to reflect the changes to the 
arrangements delivered by the new plant and systems 

The introduction of new plant and systems should be subject to extant local facility 
modification procedures to ensure the impact of this new equipment on both existing 
safety and security systems is understood and approved. The inspector should seek 
evidence of this being done prior to ‘hot commissioning’ being undertaken. 

8. 

COMMISSIONING AND PERSONNEL 

Plant and equipment are material parts of the security infrastructure.  However, 
personnel and associated processes are similarly important. Accordingly, the 
identification of Suitably Qualified and Experienced (SQEP) human resource to manage 
and operate this new equipment is necessary to deliver the capability. It is essential, 
therefore, to seek evidence that all these aspects are being addressed in the 
commissioning programme. 

9. 

COMMISSIONING AND MAINTENANCE 

Security infrastructure should provide an effective and reliable system to deliver the 
required PPS posture and outcome.  Accordingly, the long-term reliability of systems 
must be underpinned by an appropriate maintenance regime and spares holdings. This 
is supported by the provision of operating and maintenance manuals to describe those 
activities required to support system performance and the schedule for component 
replacement. Often the manufacturer will provide a recommended spares holding to 
support system reliability.

9.2 

The dutyholder should be able to demonstrate a maintenance strategy has been 
developed and is in place. It may include provision of in-house resources or contracted 
services to support the strategy. The inspector should seek confirmation that the 
dutyholder has the appropriate funding identified to support the long term operation and 
maintenance of the equipment or plant being commissioned. 

10. 

COMMISSIONING AND TRAINING 

10.1  Where appropriate, the training of staff linked to delivery of security outputs associated 

with the plant, equipment and systems being commissioned, should also be 
demonstrated. The ‘cold’ commissioning phase offers a good opportunity to review the 
adequacy of the training of operational personnel, the availability of operating 
procedures and the proposed integration of the plant and systems into the existing 
security infrastructure. This can be considered as a ‘readiness review’. The inspector 
should expect a positive decision point within the dutyholder’s plan to allow a move to 
the next phase of commissioning and written justification of such a decision. 

Inspectors should consider: 

  Does the new equipment enable the dutyholder to achieve the required PPS 

outcome? 

process? 

schedule? 

plans? 

 

Is the commissioning process underpinned by appropriate levels of internal and 
external stakeholder engagement and adequate ORs? 

  Are all appropriate stakeholders involved during the actual commissioning 

  Are there appropriate plans and procedures in place to support the 

commissioning process and the introduction of any new or amended processes 
or procedures? 

 

Is the commissioning process supported by adequate numbers of SQEP 
personnel? (managers, operators and maintainers) 

  Have whole life maintenance and training requirements been adequately 

considered during the commissioning process? 

  Are there contingency plans if security equipment is not commissioned on 

  Has security equipment being commissioned been incorporated within security 

  Does the commissioned equipment meet defined performance requirements and 

if it does not what is the response of the dutyholder? 

 

Is commissioned equipment appropriately reliable and resilient?
