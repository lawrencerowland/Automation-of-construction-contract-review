This document contains Fundamental Security \nPrinciples (FSyPs) that dutyholders must demonstrate have been fully taken into \naccount in developing their security arrangements to meet relevant legal obligations. \nThe security regime for meeting these principles is described in security plans prepared \nby the dutyholders, which are approved by ONR under the Nuclear Industries Security \nRegulations (NISR) 2003 (Reference 1).  \n\nThe term \u2018security plan\u2019 is used to cover all dutyholder submissions such as nuclear site \nsecurity plans, temporary security plans and transport security statements. NISR \nRegulation 22 dutyholders may also use the SyAPs as the basis for Cyber Security and \nInformation Assurance documentation that helps them demonstrate ongoing legal \ncompliance for the protection of Sensitive Nuclear Information (SNI). The SyAPs are \nsupported by a suite of guides to assist ONR inspectors in their assessment and \ninspection work, and in making regulatory judgements and decisions.  This Technical \nAssessment Guidance (TAG) is such a guide. \n\n2. \n\nPURPOSE AND SCOPE \n\nThis TAG contains guidance to advise and inform ONR inspectors in exercising their \nregulatory judgment during assessment activities relating to a dutyholder\u2019s \narrangements to ensure their security systems are subject to appropriate \ncommissioning. It aims to provide general advice and guidance to ONR inspectors on \nhow this aspect of security should be assessed. It does not set out how ONR regulates \nthe dutyholder\u2019s arrangements.  It does not prescribe the methodologies for dutyholders \nto follow in demonstrating they have addressed the SyAPs. It is the dutyholder\u2019s \nresponsibility to determine and describe this detail and for ONR to assess whether the \narrangements are adequate.  \n\n3. \n\nRELATIONSHIP TO LICENCE AND OTHER RELEVANT LEGISLATION \n\nThe term \u2018dutyholder\u2019 mentioned throughout this guide is used to define \u2018responsible \npersons\u2019 on civil nuclear licensed sites and other nuclear premises subject to security \nregulation, a \u2018developer\u2019 carrying out work on a nuclear construction site and approved \ncarriers, as defined in NISR. It is also used to refer to those holding SNI.  \n\nNISR defines a \u2018nuclear premises\u2019 and requires \u2018the responsible person\u2019 as defined to \nhave an approved security plan in accordance with Regulation 4. It further defines \napproved carriers and requires them to have an approved Transport Security Statement \nin accordance with Regulation 16. Persons to whom Regulation 22 applies are required \nto protect SNI. ONR considers supply chain management to be an important component \nof a dutyholder\u2019s arrangements in demonstrating compliance with relevant legislation.   \n\n4. \n\nRELATIONSHIP TO IAEA DOCUMENTATION AND GUIDANCE \n\nThe essential elements of a national nuclear security regime are set out in the \nConvention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material (CPPNM) (Reference 4) and \nthe IAEA Nuclear Security Fundamentals (Reference 3). Further guidance is available \nwithin IAEA Technical Guidance and Implementing Guides. \n\nFundamental Principle J of the CPPNM refers to quality assurance and states that a \nquality assurance policy and quality assurance programmes should be established and \nimplemented with a view to providing confidence that specified requirements for all \nactivities important to physical protection are satisfied. The importance of issues relating \n\nDoc Ref: CNS-TAST-GD-4.4 Revision 0 \nTRIM Ref: 2017/104173 \n\nPage 2 of 8 \n\n \nOFFICIAL \n\n\fOffice for Nuclear Regulation  \n \n \n\nOFFICIAL \n\nto quality assurance is also recognised in the Nuclear Security Fundamentals, \nspecifically: \n\n\uf0b7 \n\nEssential Element 12: Sustaining a Nuclear Security Regime \u2013 3.12 A nuclear \nsecurity regime ensures that each competent authority and authorised person \nand other organisations with nuclear security responsibilities contribute to the \nsustainability of the regime by: \n\na)  Developing, implementing, and maintaining appropriate and effective \nintegrated management systems including quality management \nsystems; and, \n\nh)  Routinely performing assurance activities to identify and address \n\nissues and factors that may affect the capacity to provide adequate \nnuclear security, including cyber security, at all times.  \n\nA more detailed description of the quality assurance is provided in Recommendations \nlevel guidance, specifically Nuclear Security Series (NSS) 13, Recommendations on \nPhysical Protection of Nuclear Material and Nuclear Facilities (INFCIRC/225/Revision 5) \n(Reference 2). This document states \u201cThe quality assurance policy and programmes for \nphysical protection should ensure that a physical protection system is designed, \nimplemented, operated and maintained in a condition capable of effectively responding \nto the threat assessment or design basis threat and that it meets the State\u2019s regulations, \nincluding its prescriptive and/or performance based requirements.\u201d \n\n5. \n\nRELATIONSHIP TO NATIONAL POLICY DOCUMENTS \n\nThe SyAPs provide ONR inspectors with a framework for making consistent regulatory \njudgements on the effectiveness of a dutyholder\u2019s security arrangements.  This TAG \nprovides guidance to ONR inspectors when assessing a dutyholder\u2019s submission \ndemonstrating they have effective processes in place to achieve SyDP 4.4 \u2013 \nCommissioning, in support of FSyP 4 \u2013 Nuclear Supply Chain Management.  The TAG \nis consistent with other TAGs and associated guidance and policy documentation. \n\nThe HMG Security Policy Framework (SPF) (Reference 5) describes the Cabinet \nSecretary\u2019s expectations of how HMG organisations and third parties handling HMG \ninformation and other assets will apply protective security to ensure HMG can function \neffectively, efficiently and securely. The security outcomes and requirements detailed in \nthe SPF have been incorporated within the SyAPs. This ensures that dutyholders are \npresented with a coherent set of expectations for the protection of nuclear premises, \nSNI and the employment of appropriate personnel security controls both on and off \nnuclear premises. \n\n5.3 \n\nThe Classification Policy (Reference 6) indicates those categories of SNI, which require \nprotection and the level of security classification to be applied. \n\n6. \n\nADVICE TO INSPECTORS \n\nCommissioning is the activity of setting to work systems and associated infrastructure, \nincluding assuring all systems and components are designed, installed, tested, \noperated, and maintained according to the Operational Requirements (ORs) of the \nowner. A commissioning process may be applied to new projects and existing systems, \nsubject to modifications or significant maintenance. The scale of the commissioning \nactivity should be proportionate to the level of complexity and degree of impact that the \nproject will have on the site or facility\u2019s ability to meet its security outcome as defined in \nAnnexes C and D of SyAPs.  \n\nDoc Ref: CNS-TAST-GD-4.4 Revision 0 \nTRIM Ref: 2017/104173 \n\nPage 3 of 8 \n\n \nOFFICIAL \n\n4.3 \n\n5.1 \n\n5.2 \n\n6.1 \n\n\fOffice for Nuclear Regulation  \n \n \n\n6.2 \n\nOFFICIAL \n\nThis TAG is aimed at providing guidance to the inspector when assessing the adequacy \nof the commissioning arrangements demonstrated through the performance of the \nequipment (and those personnel who will manage, operate and maintain it) and the \nadequacy of the procedures to support the operation of that equipment. As part of this \nprocess, early engagement with dutyholders is essential in order to fully understand \ntheir proposals, assess the quality and completeness of the activities and measure the \ncompliance of the plant and systems with the Physical Protection System (PPS) \noutcome and postures. This engagement should have been on-going throughout the \ndevelopment of the project. The commissioning activity is the first opportunity to confirm \nthe performance of the installation and its contribution to meeting relevant security \nobjectives.  \n\n6.3 \n\nThis TAG should also be used to consider circumstances when security equipment is \nbeing removed at a dutyholder\u2019s site, when the site is being progressively being \ndecommissioned. \n\nRegulatory Expectation \n\n6.4 \n\nThe regulatory expectation is that dutyholders demonstrate in the security plan how they \nimplement proportionate commissioning plans which should include clear definition of \nroles and responsibilities, performance indicators, availability of resources and clearly \ndefined decision points (to be met prior to moving to the next phase), as appropriate. \nWhere the plant and systems form a part of an existing infrastructure, the inspector \nshould expect to identify that a risk assessment has been undertaken to review the \npotential impact on security caused by the commissioning of the new (or refurbished) \nequipment. Planned mitigation of any associated risks should also be evidenced. \n\nFSYP 4 - Reliability, \nResilience and \nSustainability \n\nCommissioning \n\nSyDP 4.4 \n\nBefore bringing into operation or returning to service any facility, system or process \nthat may affect security it should be subject to testing and a commissioning plan \ndefined in the security plan. \n\n \n\n7. \n\n7.1 \n\n7.2 \n\n7.3 \n\nTHE COMMISSIONING PROCESS \n\nCommissioning activity should be much more than simply setting plant and equipment to \nwork. The effectiveness of security equipment to meet PPS postures and outcomes \ndescribed in SyAPs, requires the integration of a wider range of assets to support the \noperation of security equipment. This may include uninterruptable and possibly \nalternative power supplies such as diesel generators, to secure reliable performance. \nCommissioning should provide evidence and demonstrate that all aspects of the wider \ninfrastructure operate as planned in both normal and fault conditions to confirm \noperational resilience. \n\nCommissioning is typically broken into two parts usually termed \u2018cold\u2019 and \u2018hot\u2019 \ncommissioning. The former usually demonstrates the completeness of the plant and \nsystems. It confirms that all components are installed, connections made and plant \nlabelled. Evidence should be available to show this process has been undertaken and \nappropriate \u2018snagging\u2019, to put things right, has been expedited. \n\n\u2018Hot\u2019 commissioning refers to a phase when the plant and systems are energised. It is \nwhen the actual performance of the individual plant components is demonstrated \n \nOFFICIAL \n\nDoc Ref: CNS-TAST-GD-4.4 Revision 0 \nTRIM Ref: 2017/104173 \n\nPage 4 of 8 \n\n\fOffice for Nuclear Regulation  \n \n \n\nOFFICIAL \n\n7.4 \n\n7.5 \n\n7.6 \n\n7.7 \n\n7.8 \n\n8.1 \n\n9.1 \n\nagainst their specified performance. This is followed by component integration into \nsystems together with the human response elements.  The final combination of the \ndifferent systems into the overall infrastructure should prove the overall effectiveness of \nthe installation and whether it meets the intent and success criteria described in the \nORs. \n\nIntegral to this \u2018hot\u2019 commissioning phase is the record of commissioning activities. The \ninspector should expect comprehensive records to be kept of this phase of the \nprogramme. This captures the settings for plant components to deliver the system \nperformance and may need to correlate with the \u2018as tested\u2019 settings in the case of \nCentre for the Protection of National Infrastructure approved security equipment for \nexample. These base settings are important in confirming equipment remains fit for \npurpose and to enable straightforward fault finding and system re-commissioning later in \nits life. A package of information should be delivered which also includes a set of \u2018as \nbuilt\u2019 drawings, operating and maintenance procedures and requirements, a \nrecommended spares holding and other pertinent information. \n\nCommissioning plant represents the penultimate step towards operation. The inspector \nshould seek evidence from the dutyholder that the original ORs are met throughout the \ndifferent phases of commissioning. Evidence of any changes (and associated \njustifications to support them), should be available from the dutyholder. \n\nThe introduction of new or revised security equipment and systems, impacts the \napproved security plan in that it represents a change to the approved arrangements. It \nwould be expected that these changes are captured in any Security Improvement \nSchedule (SIS), itself a part of the approved security plan. \n\nThe inspector should ensure that the dutyholder is preparing the appropriate submission \nto modify the security plan (and the SIS) in order to reflect the changes to the \narrangements delivered by the new plant and systems \n\nThe introduction of new plant and systems should be subject to extant local facility \nmodification procedures to ensure the impact of this new equipment on both existing \nsafety and security systems is understood and approved. The inspector should seek \nevidence of this being done prior to \u2018hot commissioning\u2019 being undertaken. \n\n8. \n\nCOMMISSIONING AND PERSONNEL \n\nPlant and equipment are material parts of the security infrastructure.  However, \npersonnel and associated processes are similarly important. Accordingly, the \nidentification of Suitably Qualified and Experienced (SQEP) human resource to manage \nand operate this new equipment is necessary to deliver the capability. It is essential, \ntherefore, to seek evidence that all these aspects are being addressed in the \ncommissioning programme. \n\n9. \n\nCOMMISSIONING AND MAINTENANCE \n\nSecurity infrastructure should provide an effective and reliable system to deliver the \nrequired PPS posture and outcome.  Accordingly, the long-term reliability of systems \nmust be underpinned by an appropriate maintenance regime and spares holdings. This \nis supported by the provision of operating and maintenance manuals to describe those \nactivities required to support system performance and the schedule for component \nreplacement. Often the manufacturer will provide a recommended spares holding to \nsupport system reliability.  \n\nDoc Ref: CNS-TAST-GD-4.4 Revision 0 \nTRIM Ref: 2017/104173 \n\nPage 5 of 8 \n\n \nOFFICIAL \n\n\fOffice for Nuclear Regulation  \n \n \n\nOFFICIAL \n\n9.2 \n\nThe dutyholder should be able to demonstrate a maintenance strategy has been \ndeveloped and is in place. It may include provision of in-house resources or contracted \nservices to support the strategy. The inspector should seek confirmation that the \ndutyholder has the appropriate funding identified to support the long term operation and \nmaintenance of the equipment or plant being commissioned. \n\n10. \n\nCOMMISSIONING AND TRAINING \n\n10.1  Where appropriate, the training of staff linked to delivery of security outputs associated \n\nwith the plant, equipment and systems being commissioned, should also be \ndemonstrated. The \u2018cold\u2019 commissioning phase offers a good opportunity to review the \nadequacy of the training of operational personnel, the availability of operating \nprocedures and the proposed integration of the plant and systems into the existing \nsecurity infrastructure. This can be considered as a \u2018readiness review\u2019. The inspector \nshould expect a positive decision point within the dutyholder\u2019s plan to allow a move to \nthe next phase of commissioning and written justification of such a decision. \n\nInspectors should consider: \n\n\uf0b7  Does the new equipment enable the dutyholder to achieve the required PPS \n\noutcome? \n\nprocess? \n\nschedule? \n\nplans? \n\n\uf0b7 \n\nIs the commissioning process underpinned by appropriate levels of internal and \nexternal stakeholder engagement and adequate ORs? \n\n\uf0b7  Are all appropriate stakeholders involved during the actual commissioning \n\n\uf0b7  Are there appropriate plans and procedures in place to support the \n\ncommissioning process and the introduction of any new or amended processes \nor procedures? \n\n\uf0b7 \n\nIs the commissioning process supported by adequate numbers of SQEP \npersonnel? (managers, operators and maintainers) \n\n\uf0b7  Have whole life maintenance and training requirements been adequately \n\nconsidered during the commissioning process? \n\n\uf0b7  Are there contingency plans if security equipment is not commissioned on \n\n\uf0b7  Has security equipment being commissioned been incorporated within security \n\n\uf0b7  Does the commissioned equipment meet defined performance requirements and \n\nif it does not what is the response of the dutyholder? \n\n\uf0b7 \n\nIs commissioned equipment appropriately reliable and resilient? \n\n \n\n \n\nDoc Ref: CNS-TAST-GD-4.4 Revision 0 \nTRIM Ref: 2017/104173 \n\nPage 6 of 8 \n\n \nOFFICIAL \n\n\fOffice for Nuclear Regulation  \n \n \n\n11. \n\nREFERENCES \n\nOFFICIAL \n\nNuclear Industries Security Regulations 2003.

The intention is to \n\n1.5 \nhighlight typical construction assurance items that a licensee would be expected to \naddress during the design and construction phases of a construction project. \nAppendix 1, identifies some typical aspects, which an ONR inspector may wish to \nconsider, or seek further specialist opinion on.  \n\nIt is to be expected that further assurance may be sought throughout the \n\n1.6 \ncommissioning, handover and operational phases of a facility.  However, this TAG \nonly considers construction assurance up to \u2018practical completion\u2019 by the civil \nengineering contractor of its works. \n\n1.7  General reference has been made within this guide to issues relating to both \nquality and design assurance during the design and construction phases, however \nfurther information is contained in the following guides for these subject areas:- \n\n\uf09f  T/INS/17, quality assurance;  \n\uf09f  T/INS/19, construction or installation of new plant;  \n\uf09f  T/AST/57, design safety assurance.  \n\n1.8 \nThe principles described within the above guides are considered \u2018relevant \ngood practice\u2019 to ensure that within the life cycle of a construction project, what is \nconstructed is indeed the physical form of the design intent, and further that both \nhave been executed to a suitable standard, thus ensuring the quality of the product \nis right for the categorisation and classification of the structure and/or component \nbeing considered. \n\n1.9 \nIt is important for the assumptions made by the designer, incorporated within \nthe justification of the design within a safety case, to be properly carried through the \nconstruction phase. The final construction of the works is thus as much a part of the \nsafety case as the design. \n\n2.0  Relationship to licence and other relevant legislation \n\n2.1 \nLicence conditions 14; 17; 19; 20; 22 are the principal relevant licence \nconditions requiring the licensee to make and implement adequate arrangements.  \n\nLicence condition 14, relating to safety documentation, requires that the \n2.2 \nlicensee \u201cshall make and implement adequate arrangements for the production and \nassessment of safety cases consisting of documentation to justify safety during the \ndesign, construction, manufacture, commissioning, operation and decommissioning \nphases of the installation.\u201d \n\n2.3 \nLicence condition 17, relating to management systems, requires the licensee \nto \u201cmake and implement adequate quality management arrangements in respect of \nall matters which may affect safety\u201d. \n\n \n\n2\n\n\fLicence condition 19, relating to construction or installation of new plant, \n2.4 \nrequires that \u201cWhere the licensee proposes to construct or install any new plant \nwhich may affect safety the licensee shall make and implement adequate \narrangements to control the construction or installation.\u201d \n\nLicence condition 20, relating to modification to design of plant under \n\n2.5 \nconstruction, requires that \u201cThe licensee shall ensure that no modification to the \ndesign which may affect safety is made to any plant during the period of construction \nexcept in accordance with adequate arrangements made and implemented by the \nlicensee for that purpose.\u201d \n\nLicence condition 22, relating to modification or experiment on existing plant,  \n\n2.6 \nrequires that \u201cThe licensee shall make and implement adequate arrangements to \ncontrol any modification or experiment carried out on any part of the existing plant or \nprocesses which may affect safety.\u201d \n\n2.7  By the very nature of the subject and potential effect on safety there are many \nother possible relevant licence conditions  including LC 26 - control and supervision \nof operations; LC 25 operational records; LC 12 duly authorised and other suitably \nqualified and experienced persons. \n\nThe general duties under the health and safety at work act7, sections S2(1) ; \n\n2.8 \nS3(1); S4(1); S4(2) and S6(1)a , impose statutory duties.  \n\nThe Construction (Design and Management) Regulations 20078, places duties \n\n2.9 \non designers to have \u201cadequate regard to the need:\u2013  \n\u201c(i) to avoid foreseeable risks to the health and safety of any person at work carrying \nout construction work or cleaning work in or on the structure at any time, or of any \nperson who may be affected by the work of such a person at work take due \nrecognition of health and safety in the design and implementation process.\u201d  \n\n2.10  Section 8(2)a of the Ionising Radiation Regulations9 also make specific \nreference to engineering controls and design features, to achieve the restriction of \nexposure to ionising radiation. \n\n3.0   Relationship to SAP\u2019s, IAEA safety standards, etc \n\n3.1  Reference should be made to the HSE\u2019s safety assessment principles \n(SAPs)11 for nuclear facilities together with other relevant technical assessment \nguides (TAGs) when assessing such design and construction arrangements, \nprocesses and procedures.  The most relevant safety assessment principles for \nconstruction related activities are the civil engineering principles ECE.16 \u2013ECE.19.  \n\n3.2  ECE.16: Civil construction materials should be compliant with the design \nmethodologies used, and shown to be suitable for the purpose of enabling the \ndesign to be constructed, operated, inspected and maintained throughout the life of \nthe facility. \n\n3.3  ECE.17: The construction should use appropriate materials, proven \ntechniques and approved procedures to minimise the occurrence of defects that \nmight affect the required integrity of structures. \n\n \n\n3\n\n\f3.4   ECE.18: Provision should be made for inspection during construction to \ndemonstrate that the required standard of workmanship has been achieved, \n\n3.5  ECE.19: Where construction non conformities are judged to have a \ndetrimental effect on integrity or significant defects are detected, remedial measures \nshould achieve the original design intent. \n\n3.6  Other relevant SAP\u2019s are, Leadership and management for safety,  \nMS 1-4;Safety classification and standards: ECS 1-3 and Decommissioning: DC 1, 6  \n\nThe 2006 SAPs were also benchmarked against the extant IAEA Safety \n\n3.7 \nStandards and their main principles are encompassed within the SAPs11. \n\nThe IAEA Safety Standards GS-R-3 and GS-G-3.1 provide advice on quality \n\n3.8 \nmanagement and assurance aspects applicable to construction activities. \n\n3.9  Other relevant guidance can be found in NS-R-1, safety for NPP design; NS-\nR-3 Site evaluation for nuclear installations , section 6 on quality control; NS-G-3.6 \nGeotechnical aspects of site evaluation and foundation for NPP. \n\n3.10  WENRA reactor safety reference levels18 relating to:- \nA) Safety policy, S1 Issuing and Communication of a Safety policy (S1.1, 1.5); B) \nOperating Organisation, S1 Organisational Structure (S1.2,1.3), S2 Management of \nSafety and Quality (S2.6) , S3 Sufficiency and Competency of Staff (S3.6);   \nC) Management System, S5 Process Implementation (S5.5, 5.6, 5.7,5.8), S6 \nMeasurement, Assessment and Improvement (S6.4,6.5);  \nD) Training and Authorisation of NPP staff, S2 Competence and Qualification (S2.1), \nS3 Training Programmes and Facilities (S3.6), S4 Authorisation (S4.3);  \nG) Safety classification of structures, systems and components S1 objective (S1.1) , \nS2 Classification Process (S2.2) , S3 Ensuring Reliability (S3.1), S4 Selection of \nmaterials and qualification of equipment (S4.2);   \nH) Operational Limits and Conditions S1 Purpose (S1.1), are all relevant. \n\n4.0  General advice to inspectors \n\n4.1 \nThis section provides general advice on ONR expectations and potential \nareas to target during inspection/assessment. More specific advice on some features \nassociated with construction assurance is then given, firstly during the development \nand design phases of the project (Section 5.1) and then during the construction \nphase (Section 5.2). \n\n4.2  During both the design and the construction phase\u2019s of a project, quality \nassurance and design assurance are inextricably linked to the issues surrounding \nconstruction assurance.  A number of existing technical assessment guides are \nrelevant to these specific subject areas and the Inspector should consider the latest \navailable information. \n\n \n\n4\n\n\f4.3 \n\nThe following guides are useful initial reference points:- \n\nT/INS/017 \u2013 Quality Assurance \nT/AST/017 \u2013 Structural integrity, civil engineering aspects3 \nT/AST/039 \u2013 Management for safety1 \nT/AST/057 \u2013 Design safety assurance2 \n\n4.4  Whilst it is recognised that design organisations may not be the licence \nholder, both the design and construction process should be under the control of the \nappropriate licensee acting as an \u201cintelligent customer\u201d. SAP\u2019s11 (paragraph 56). \n\n4.5  ONR expects that for construction of a nuclear facility the standards employed \nare commensurate with the magnitude and nature of the hazard presented by the \nfacility, and are higher than for general industrial design and construction works. \nSuitable safety categorisation and classification by the licensee should set the \nrequirements for the extent of control and assurance that the design and \nconstruction of a facility is subject to. \n\n4.6  Prior to the submission of the Pre Construction Safety Report (PCSR) by the \nlicensee, ONR assessment is more likely to focus on standards and principles being \nemployed, the visibility of optioneering to demonstrate ALARP, and the adequacy of \nthe design process and associated arrangements.  \n\n4.7  ONR inspectors need to satisfy themselves that the licensee understands the \nimportance of construction assurance, that appropriate processes have been put in \nplace and that aspects which will provide construction assurance are being given \nappropriate consideration during the development and design phases of the project.  \n\nThe inspector should seek assurance that between: the safety case claims; \n\n4.8 \nthe civil design substantiation; the specification of the design details and the \nconstruction competency of the contractors that the licensee chooses to employ, \nthere is a consistency of purpose.   \n\nIn addition confidence needs to be gained that the licensee\u2019s construction \n4.9 \nassurance processes are targeted at achieving an acceptable outcome, so far as \ncan be established during the development and design phases of the project.  In \nparticular confidence needs to be gained that the civil engineering designer\u2019s \nintentions will be specified in a manner that can be realised by competent SQEP \ncontractors.  \n\n4.10  Following submission of the PCSR but prior to permissioning, the licensee\u2019s \nprocesses should be fully documented. In addition, activities subject to a permission \nby ONR should be fully defined.  ONR focus at this stage will be towards the \ntechnical details, but the licensees systems and procedures must be seen to be \ncapable of delivering the requirements of the design and safety case. \n\n4.11  Following permissioning and commencement of construction ONR focus is \nmore likely to be on management and technical control in order to ensure that the \ncompleted installation conforms to the specified requirements.  Firstly, to confirm the \nsuitability and sufficiency of all that has been documented as the input to an assured \nconstruction process.  Secondly, to ascertain those organisations responsible for \n\n \n\n5\n\n\fconstruction activities fully understand the documented construction information.  \nThirdly, to confirm by observation that construction is proceeding in a controlled and \nvalidated manner, and lastly to gain confidence that the civil engineering structures \nare being constructed as specified without undermining of any of the design \nassumptions. \n\n4.12  On-site inspections of construction activities should focus on areas of highest \nnuclear safety significance where high standards are required and/or on any novel \ntechniques being employed.  \n\n4.13   Appendix 1 outlines some specific aspects of civil engineering where \ninspectors may wish to focus their attention during the construction phase of a \nproject.  This is included as an aide memoire for Inspectors but the list is not \nconsidered in any way to be definitive or exhaustive.  \n\n5.0   Development and Design Phase \n\n5.1   Quality during the design phase \n\n5.1.1\u2018  Quality assurance and quality control are aspects of good management\u20195, in \nthis respect, areas relating to design and subsequent construction need to be \nappropriately managed to achieve the required quality of the product.  \n\n5.1.2   Areas for consideration during the design phase may include, but not be \nlimited to: - \n\n\uf09f  Organisations and the communications between them  \n\uf09f  Staffing and training , including SQEP evaluation \n\uf09f  Document control, including preparation, review , approval and change control  \n\uf09f  Design control, including interfaces, verification, validation  and changes  \n\uf09f  Procurement control, including supplier evaluation and selection, control of \n\nitems and services purchased  \n\nReference should be made to T/INS /017 on Quality Assurance. \n\n5.2   Design categorisation and classification \n\n5.2.1   Structures, systems and components (SSC) should be designed and specified \nto provide the required engineering functionality. This functionality will have an \ninfluence on safety and so requires an appropriate safety category to be assigned.  \n\n5.2.2   ONR expectation is that the processes and procedures considered should be \nto an appropriate level dependent upon the categorisation and classification being \napplied.  \n\n5.2.3   Categorisation and classification will affect:-   \n\n\uf09f \n\uf09f \n\uf09f \n\uf09f \n\uf09f \n\nthe design methods used and their extent;  \nthe standards to be used; \nthe material selections made;  \nthe procurement processes used;  \nthe methods of fabrication and installation;  \n\n \n\n6\n\n\f\uf09f \n\nthe extent and type of inspections as well as maintenance requirements and \nin- service inspections proposed.  \n\n5.3   Codes and standards \n\n5.3.1   Whilst BS and Euro EN codes, (including nationally determined annexes) may \nnot be specifically written with nuclear facility designs in mind, it is noted that they \nmay form the base understanding of the contractor in terms of control of materials, \nworkmanship, durability, tolerances, testing and inspection regimes. \n\n5.3.2   It is customary in the UK nuclear industry for designers to utilise other \ninternational or USA codes as part of the design process. These may also be \nsupplemented or replaced entirely by the licensees own standards. Differences in \ndimensional or other units may emanate from foreign designs and this aspect may \nwell require further consideration. \n\n5.3.3   It is therefore important to recognise that codes may set standards and \nrequirements for construction details, workmanship, concrete mix design, \nreinforcement and fixing details, material specifications and in the case of the EN \ncodes, options for control of construction which may be unfamiliar to a UK \nconstruction work force.  \n\n5.3.4   Care needs to be exercised at the detailed design stage that appropriate \naccount is taken of these aspects ensuring that the design intent is carried through \nas anticipated during the construction process. Appendix 1 provides some examples \nwhere the design intent may not be met unless the requirements are clearly \ncommunicated by the designer to the contractor. \n\n5.3.5   The contract drawings, schedules and construction specification should \ninclude all design, workmanship, inspection and testing requirements to be fulfilled \nduring the construction process.  However, it would also be expected that the \ndesigner highlights areas to the contractor that might not represent \u2018normal\u2019 practice \nin order to establish the practicality of the proposal and ensure the contractor \nunderstands the full requirements. \n\n5.3.6   In addition the licensee should have sufficient capability to understand such \nissues and their bearing on safety and fulfil the role of an intelligent customer. Refer \nto T/AST/04921. \n\n5.4   Material use \n\n5.4.1   International codes tend to base design on the materials available within the \ncountry of origin. These materials may not be the standard / readily accepted / \nreadily available norms in the UK, for example reinforcing bar yield strengths.  \n\n5.4.2   Useful information may be obtained from the relevant industry bodies such as \nCARES22 for rebar, BCSA31 for steel construction, IMS32 for masonry. \n\n5.4.3   The designer needs to specify materials (for instance reinforcement bars) that \nwill meet the relevant structural requirements in a manner that is acceptable to the \ncontractor.  Failure to communicate and agree with the contractor these \nrequirements will lead to formal design change requests later.  Changes in materials \n\n \n\n7\n\n\fsubsequent to the completion of the design should be kept to a minimum as \ndetermining the implications for the design can require multi disciplinary specialist \nknowledge and if there are numerous design changes there is a risk that the \nspecialists may not be aware of all the changes when making a decision. \n\n5.5   Codes and testing requirements \n\n5.5.1   International / USA codes13,23,24,25  such as American Institute of Steel \nConstruction (ANSI/AISC 360) Specification for structural steel buildings23 or \nAmerican Concrete Institute (ACI 349)13 Code requirements for nuclear safety \nrelated concrete structures, may base the design on differing forms of test results \nand requirements . For example the use of cylinder compressive strengths instead of \ncube compressive strengths (see also Appendix 1).   \n\n5.5.2   ONR expectation is that the principal contractor / contractor should be fully \nconversant with the relevant codes used and further that suitably qualified and \nexperienced personnel (SQEP) are employed in the relevant site supervisory roles. \nAn Inspection and Test Plan (ITP) should be agreed with the licensee. \n\n5.6   Alignment of the civil engineering design and safety case  \n\n5.6.1   The PCSR should document how operational and safety functional \nrequirements have been derived and communicated to the civil engineering designer \nin a clear manner. \n\n5.6.2   The designer\u2019s requirements are generally communicated to the contractor \nthrough the contract drawings, schedules and construction specification.  It is \nexpected that these documents would include all design, workmanship, inspection \nand testing requirements to be fulfilled during the construction process. \n\n5.6.3   It is an ONR expectation that the designer and contractor engage in early \ndialogue regarding the methods to be used, the design intent and possible contractor \n\u2018optioneering\u2019. This is considered an important stage in the early communication of \nboth the design and the assumptions made during the design to fulfil the safety case \njustification. \n\n6.0   Construction Phase \n\n6.1   Quality during the construction phase \n\n6.1.1   The general information on quality assurance and quality control presented in \nsection 5.1.1 during the design is also applicable during the construction phase.  \nAreas for consideration during the construction phase may include, but not be limited \nto: - \n\n\uf09f  Site control, including identification and control of materials, parts and \n\ncomponents, handling storage and shipping  \n\n\uf09f  Process control; including planning, procedures, permits, hold points, method \n\nstatements \nInspection, monitoring  and testing  \n\n\uf09f \n\uf09f  Non conformance control  \n\uf09f  Corrective actions, including close out and verification \n\n \n\n8\n\n\f\uf09f  Records, including as designed and as constructed, maintenance and \n\noperational manuals \n\n6.2   Forms of contract \n\n6.2.1   It is an ONR expectation that criteria should have been set by the licensee for \nselection of the most appropriate form of contract33.  The selection criteria should \ntake into account the potential impact of administering and applying the contract on \nthe quality of the outputs from the contract where such outputs affect nuclear safety.   \n\n6.2.2   Some factors affecting the quality of outputs may include:   \n\n\uf09f  Commercial pressures (for example in fixed price lump sum contracts, \n\nparticularly in the delivery of complex safety related designs or components) \n\uf09f \nImpact of the prescription of an overly-challenging contract programme  \n\uf09f  Suitability of the contract in relation to the maturity of the data that is to be \n\nused as input to the contract. \n\n6.3   Supply chain management \n\n6.3.1   Control and monitoring of contractors may be made more difficult by \nincreases in the length of a supply chain. Even with \u2018back to back \u2018contracts the \noriginal design philosophy and assumptions can be lost or misunderstood through \ndistance from the original intent.  \n\n6.3.2   A further complication may exist in the control / verification of SQEP \npersonnel and the overall quality by the licensee of the manufacture and supply of \nsafety related components or designs. For example, when significant design is \nincluded in \u2018design and build\u2019 forms of contract the design element of the contract \nmay be further subcontracted thus becoming increasingly more remote within a \nsupply chain.   \n\n6.3.3   It is an ONR expectation that a similar standard of quality assurance as \napplied by the licensee is evident and verifiable throughout the supply chain for \nnuclear safety related items. It is also expected that supply chain lengths are \nminimised as much as practicable. \n\n6.3.4   Safety culture and safety awareness is as important as verifiable documentary \nform filling. Contractors would also be expected to exhibit a safety culture and safety \nawareness with a \u2018questioning attitude\u2019 similar to that of the licensee. \n\n6.4   Design assumptions \u2013 verification \n\n6.4.1   During the design certain assumptions may be made. For example, \nassumptions based on ground investigation data obtained. However, site conditions \nin actuality may vary. Examples such as: \n\n\uf09f  Varying ground water levels \n\uf09f  Settlement \n\uf09f  Anomalies in ground conditions from those expected from ground \n\ninvestigations \n\n\uf09f  Unforeseen Services \n\n \n\n9\n\n\fIt is important therefore that the design team are apprised of site conditions found \nduring the construction.   \n\n6.4.2   The use of approved contractor method statements, hold point control plans, \npermits to dig can also be a useful means of reviewing design assumptions. \n\n6.4.3   It is an ONR expectation that a comprehensive quality management system \nshould be implemented that allows the full implications of site issues to be \nconsidered against the original design assumptions, ensuring the design intent is \ncarried through the construction process. \n\n6.4.4   Of particular importance is a process whereby it is demonstrated that the \ncontractor\u2019s methods and materials are capable of delivering the designer\u2019s \nintentions, especially when nuclear safety is dependent on non-standard \nconstruction methods and materials.  Construction assurance and the necessity to \ndemonstrate ALARP means that there should be a culture of continuous \nimprovement and to this end it would be expected that construction reviews would be \nundertaken during the construction process. \n\n6.5   Suitably qualified and experienced people SQEP  \n\n6.5.1   The importance of utilising the \u2018right\u2019 people, with the \u2018right\u2019 level of \nunderstanding and knowledge at the \u2018right\u2019 time should not be underestimated.  \n\n6.5.2   It is an ONR expectation that suitably qualified and experienced personnel \n(SQEP) in accordance with licence condition LC 12 are used at every level and that \npre- training prior to contract is considered where appropriate. Reference should also \nbe made to ONR guidance T/INS/01217, DAP\u2019s and SQEP\u2019s. \n\n6.5.3   It is an ONR expectation that all SQEP records should be kept up-to-date \nthroughout the duration of a project and at all levels throughout the supply chain.  \n\n6.6   Communication \n\n6.6.1   Good, clear, timely communication between individuals, teams and \ncompanies is important. Clear lines of communication and expectations are all part \nof a quality culture. Good communication is vital and it is an ONR expectation that a \nconstruction project should have systems in place that reflect this requirement. This \nrequirement should extend to all parties involved and at all levels including \ncommunications between the contractor and the designer. Co- located project offices \nshould be considered as a means of facilitating communication. \n\n6.7   Design changes \n\n6.7.1   It is recognised that changes to the design may arise from various sources \nand for a variety of reasons during the construction process.  It is ONR\u2018s expectation \nthat the licensee, together with the design and construction teams, should operate \nrigorous systems to capture, record, justify and implement any proposed changes, \nhowever they are initiated. \n\n \n\n10\n\n\f6.7.2   The systems and procedures used should allow a suitably qualified and \nexperienced person (SQEP) to decide on the implications of each proposal and \npermit them to be fed back to the relevant members of the design team for \nconsideration and agreement to the change, as necessary. \n\n6.7.3   Construction on a licensed site is subject to LC 20 \u2013 modification to design of \nplant under construction, and appropriate safety classification arrangements are \nrequired. \n\n6.8   Non conformances \n\n6.8.1   During the construction process non-conformances may occur. It is important \nthat there are appropriate procedures and processes within the project team to \nrecord non-conformances and confirm the actions taken through the design team to \naddress any issues resulting from a non-conformance. \n\n6.8.2   It is ONR\u2019s expectation that the licensee, designer and contractors should \nhave a suitable system for recording and dealing with all non- conformances.  \n\n6.8.3   A site culture should be engendered, such that contractors are positively \nencouraged to report openly any potential non-conformances no matter how they \nhave arisen.  Generally, a \u2018questioning attitude\u2019 should be fostered within the \nconstruction team.  \n\n6.9   Certification of materials \n\n6.9.1   In a modern global market, materials and components may not originate in the \nEU but may be sourced from around the world. Whilst this brings with it certain \nbenefits it can also bring challenges ranging from the provision of false certification \ncovering dubious quality control in manufacture to a lack of real auditable / \ntraceability of components through to counterfeit parts entering the supply chain. \nThis lack of an auditable quality trail means that the specification may be \ncompromised, threatening any claims made in the safety case. \n\n6.9.2   It is ONR\u2019s expectation that batch traceability of all materials should be \navailable and for high integrity items, component traceability should also be \navailable.  The licensee should also consider verification testing by third party of \ncertain high safety significance items. \n\n6.10   Contractor self certification \n\n6.10.1 \u201cCertification by the work originator of the design and construction of \nstructures whose failure would not have high consequences can give adequate \nassurance of structural safety provided there are appropriate systems in place for \nensuring competence\u201d14.  \n\n6.10.2 However, for safety critical items of plant or nuclear related construction \nprocesses whose failure would have high consequences, third party independent \ncertification should be used to give added assurance of structural / nuclear safety. \nAn appropriate level of checks and certification should be found within these two \nextremes. \n\n \n\n11\n\n\f6.10.3 Whilst quality cannot be inspected into the construction process it is an ONR \nexpectation that the licensee\u2019s arrangements should include additional supervision \nand management systems to control the construction activity of nuclear related \nconstruction and reduce risks to nuclear safety.  \n\n6.10.4 It is an ONR expectation therefore that the certification of structural nuclear \nsafety related work should thus only be entrusted to appropriately qualified and \nexperienced people. \n\n6.10.5 Reference to licence condition LC 12 concerning duly authorised and other \nsuitably qualified and experienced persons should also be made. \n\n6.11   Third party assurance \n\n6.11.1 ONR\u2019s expectation is that appropriate quality systems should be applied as \nnecessary throughout all levels of a project supply chain in accordance with licence \ncondition LC17. Refer also to T/INS/01728. \n\n6.11.2 Given the potential scale of some projects it is possible that construction \nconsortiums may be envisaged. This process may lead to project teams working to a \nconglomerate of systems. Whilst parts may be familiar to certain members of the \nteam, other parts are not. This interface needs to be recognised, understood, \nplanned and managed such that an effective, efficient quality plan is produced. \n\n6.12   Contractor selected materials  \n\n6.12.1 It is ONR\u2019s expectation that a suitable contractor proposed material approval \nsystem should be implemented by the licensee.  Material selection by the \nconstruction team within the specification should be verified by the original designer \nagainst the original design intent as translated into the specification and hence \nagainst any claims on the safety case and validated as such. \n\nReference should also be made to the Construction (Design and Management) \nRegulations and associated ACoP29 in relation to designers. \n\n6.13   Testing, monitoring and inspection \n\n6.13.1 It is ONR\u2019s expectation that the use of hold points for certain testing and or \ninspections should be considered. Requirements should be clearly stated in the \nspecification and should incorporate standards appropriate to the categorisation and \nclassification of the structure, system or component. The requirements should be \nincorporated into agreed test and inspection plans, and hold point control plans, \nwhich have been integrated within the risk management process and programme.  \nThe use of approved contractor method statements may also act as a hold point and \ncontrol over works on site. Refer also to IAEA NS-G-3.630 ; Section 2, site \ninvestigation; Section 4, consideration for foundations; Section 7, monitoring of \ngeotechnical parameters, for further details relating specifically to site investigation. \n\n \n\n12\n\n\f6.14   As-constructed records \n\n6.14.1 \u201cAs-constructed records have in the past received various levels of attention \nat the end of a project.  Records management and retention is often found to be an \narea for poor practice or sometimes records not available due to the time delays in \ntheir production\u201d8. \n\n6.14.2 It is ONR\u2019s expectation that as-constructed records should provide a fully \nreferenced account of the work actually constructed and should be produced in a \ntimely manner as the information becomes available throughout the contract. \n\n6.14.3 General progress photographs may be useful during the construction phase \nbut will generally be inadequate for more detailed recording of \u2018as-constructed\u2019 items.  \n\n6.14.4 However, for the purposes of verification of construction detail, particularly \nareas which cannot be readily inspected, will become inaccessible, concealed or \ncovered once complete, it is ONR\u2019s expectation that detailed referenced \nphotographs should be retained and used as part of the as-constructed records.  As-\nconstructed records are an important aspect of future verification and maintenance \nand as such suitable and adequate provision should be made for their retention. \n\n6.15   Modular design elements \n\n6.15.1 The use of modular design elements and precast units manufactured off site \ncan have benefit in terms of quality, time/ programme but bring with them potential \nproblems. There is an increasing tendency to make such elements as large as \npossible. Problems of long periods in storage; haulage; transport across site; \ncraneage; and incorporation details should all be considered both in the design and \nwithin the risk management plan and be part of an agreed and considered \nconstruction philosophy and methodology.  \n\n6.15.2 It is ONR\u2019s expectation that early dialogue between the designer and \ncontractor should occur to discuss elements of the construction process and how this \ncan be best achieved. \n\n6.16   Barriers to understanding \n\n6.16.1 Barriers to understanding may arise through foreign companies entering the \nUK market. This could include both design houses or design teams working abroad \nand foreign contractors working in the UK. \n\n6.16.2 \u201cWith construction companies carrying fewer of their own operatives, there \ntends to be a heavy reliance on labour only (LO) subcontract organisations. \n\nMany of these organisations have a diverse workforce. Language barriers are \ncommon within these workforces, giving challenges in the communication of health \nand safety requirements during site induction and toolbox safety talks\u201d15. \n\n6.16.3 The use of global workforces may reduce the level of ownership and \ncommitment, fragmenting the quality culture ethos that is necessary within the \nworkforce. \n\n \n\n13\n\n\f6.16.4 It is ONR expectation that a robust system of checks to understanding should \nbe incorporated into both induction and toolbox talks relating to health, safety and \nconstruction quality issues and that relevant SQEP supervisory staff are employed. \n\n6.17   Performance indicators \n\n6.17.1 The selection of inappropriate performance indicators either key performance \nindicators (KPI\u2019s) or safety performance indicators (SPI\u2019s) can produce a negative \nculture.  \n\n6.17.2 It is ONR\u2019s expectation that careful consideration should be given to the \nselection and use of relevant indicators and their effect on the drivers for the project. \nEvidence of monitoring the effects of KPI\u2019s / SPI\u2019s over time should be used.  \n\n6.18   Demolition / decommissioning \n\n6.18.1 Reference should be made to the Safety Assessment Principles (SAP\u2019s)11, \nSafety principles DC 1-8 together with the relevant guidance. \n\n6.18.2 CIRIA report T 30.001 Demolition, Dismantling and Decommissioning \nRev 03 [Jan 09]19 may also be a useful guide on aspects of demolition.  \n\n6.18.3 It is ONR\u2019s expectation that decommissioning and demolition of structures \nshould be considered during the planning, design, construction and operational \nstages and in line with licence Condition LC 35 and the CDM regulations8.\n\n \n\n14\n\n\fAppendix 1  - Areas of Construction and Expectations  \n \n\nThe following table provides areas of civil engineering related to new construction works, which inspectors may wish to use as a prompt for \nfurther consideration and thought.

The principles \npresented in the SAPs are supplemented by a suite of guides to further assist \nONR\u2019s inspectors in their technical assessment work in support of making \nregulatory judgements and decisions.  This Technical Assessment Guide (TAG) \nis one of these guides. \n\n2. \n\nPURPOSE AND SCOPE \n\nThis Technical Assessment Guide provides guidance on ONR\u2019s approach to \nthe control of nuclear matter, the relevant legislative constraints and definitions \nand on the application of relevant ONR Safety Assessment Principles (SAPs) \n[1], as described in section 4.1 below. \n\nNuclear matter must be controlled to protect people from harm and to protect \nthe environment, safeguard fissile material and to secure hazardous \ninstallations and materials. Harm may result from the radioactive properties of \nnuclear matter, or by combination of its radioactive properties with toxic, \nexplosive or other hazardous properties. Recognition of the impact that? \nnuclear matter may have on safety is implicit throughout the SAPs. \n\n2.3 \n\nThe principal definition of nuclear matter used by ONR is that given in the \nglossary to the SAPs, based on the definition used in the Nuclear Installations \nAct (NIA): \n\nSubject to any exceptions prescribed in NIA and the Nuclear Installations \n(Excepted Matter) Regulations 2017[2], nuclear matter is: \n\n1  any  fissile  material  in  the  form  of  uranium  metal,  alloy  or \nchemical  compound  (including  natural  uranium),  or  of  plutonium \nmetal,  alloy  or  chemical  compound,  and  any  other  fissile  material \nwhich may be prescribed;  \n\n2  any  radioactive  material  produced  in,  or  made  radioactive  by \nexposure to the radiation incidental to, the process of producing or \nutilising any such fissile material as aforesaid. \n\nIt should be noted that following the commencement of the Nuclear Safeguards \nAct 2018 the definition of \u201cqualifying nuclear material\u201d overlaps the definition of \nexcepted matter arising through NIA and as such, material that may meet the \ncriteria to be considered as excepted matter may still be qualifying nuclear \nmaterial for safeguards purposes.  In any case involving such material, ONR \nSafeguards should be consulted. \n\nThis guidance therefore applies to all types of nuclear matter, including \nexcepted matter (see the Appendix) unless the wording makes it clear that \nlimited application was intended, or unless it can be shown that the total \namount of nuclear matter concerned is sufficiently small or is in such a \nchemical or physical form as to make it unnecessary to apply to any one or \nmore of the SAPs. The SAPs require the identification of \u201call initiating faults \nhaving the potential to lead to \u2026.. a significant quantity of radioactive \nmaterial escaping from its designated place of residence or confinement\u201d \n(fault analysis principle FA.2). \n\nReport  NS-TAST-GD-023 \nCM9 Ref: 2019/0250250 \n\nPage 2 of 14 \n\nOFFICIAL \n \n\n\fOffice for Nuclear Regulation  \n \n \n\nOFFICIAL \n\n2.6 \n\nInterpretation of \u201ccontrol\u201d should not be restricted to the need for control and \ninstrumentation (C&I) systems. In this context, control relates to the ability to \nmanage a hazardous material. However, the legislation does not define fully the \ntype of control required, for example, Licence Condition (LC) 4 states only that \n\u201cadequate arrangements\u201d should exist for nuclear matter brought onto site. \n\n2.7 \n\nThe nature of the control required can be determined from a number of \nsources, including (in no particular order): \n\n\uf0b7 \n\n\uf0b7 \n\n\uf0b7 \n\n\uf0b7 \n\n\uf0b7 \n\n\uf0b7 \n\n\uf0b7 \n\n\uf0b7 \n\nLegislation, primary and secondary. \n\nthe nuclear site licence conditions . \n\nPublished standards. \n\nONR\u2019s  Safety  Assessment  Principles  and  Technical  Assessment \nGuides. \n\nComparison with relevant good practice in the UK and abroad. \n\nGood design and analysis of appropriate systems and equipment. \n\nLegal Guidance from ONR\u2019s solicitors or legal advisory service. \n\nFor  material  meeting  the  criteria  to  be  \u201cqualifying  nuclear  matter\u201d, \nSafeguards requirements. \n\nThis guidance covers the key concepts of inventory control. In this context, \ncontrol should be applied proportionately and according to the meanings of \nrelevant ONR guidance, for example on limits and conditions [3] and functional \nsafety systems [4]. \n\nNuclear matter has to be managed through all stages in the life-cycle of a \nfacility and most of the SAPs will apply to nuclear matter at some stage.  Many \nspecific principles in other sub-sections are particularly relevant, e.g. \ncontainment and ventilation [SAP-ECV.1 to 10] and other guidance should be \nconsulted for the assessment of equipment designs or specific operations. \n\n2.10  On civilian sites, responsibilities for ensuring the security and safeguards of \n\nnuclear material are regulated by ONR Civil Nuclear Security and Safeguards \n(CNSS) Division1. \n\n3. \n\nRELATIONSHIP TO LICENCE AND OTHER RELEVANT LEGISLATION \n\n3.1 \n\nExplicit reference to nuclear matter is found in LC 4 and 5. \n\nLC 4 is concerned with the necessity of \u201cadequate arrangements\u201d for bringing \nnuclear matter onto a licensed site and for its storage there. Arrangements \ncovering issues addressed by the relevant SAPs and this guidance should be \nconsistent with any relevant information in a Safety Case, and the advice herein \nwill be useful in addressing such arrangements as well as other relevant \naspects of safety cases as a whole. \n\nLC 5 is concerned with the regulatory control of consignments from a licensed \nsite and the records required to be kept. Its main purpose is to ensure that \nHSE/ONR can identify destination sites for which a new licence might be \nneeded. \n\n2.8 \n\n2.9 \n\n3.2 \n\n3.3 \n\n                                                 \n1 Subject to the final position post-Brexit the period of shadow regulation may continue for a period. \n\nReport  NS-TAST-GD-023 \nCM9 Ref: 2019/0250250 \n\nPage 3 of 14 \n\nOFFICIAL \n \n\n\fOffice for Nuclear Regulation  \n \n \n\n3.4 \n\n3.5 \n\n4.1 \n\n4.2 \n\n4.3 \n\nOFFICIAL \n\nOther laws and regulations affecting nuclear installations define the materials \nwithin their scope in slightly different ways. The appendix to this guide expands \non the definitions. Since all the legislation described in the appendix requires \nsome control over radioactive/nuclear material, this guidance is relevant to all \nnuclear legislation in varying degrees. \n\nLC 34 requires that licensees ensure, so far as is reasonably practicable, that \nradioactive material and radioactive waste on the site is at all times controlled \nor contained so that it cannot leak or otherwise escape. Assessment of \narrangements to comply with this licence condition should therefore also take \naccount of this guidance. Arrangements made under LCs 23 and 27 on \noperating rules and safety mechanisms may also be relevant in this respect. \nArrangements for the periodic review of safety cases under LC 15 will also be \nrelevant as such reviews should address aspects of control and containment, \nshortfalls against modern standards and the relevant overall site strategies for \nthe control of nuclear matter. \n\n3.6 \n\nAs described in section 2 above, qualifying nuclear material for safeguards \npurposes may also be nuclear matter, as such, the views of ONR Safeguards \nshould be sought wherever it is appropriate to do so. \n\n4. \n\nRELATIONSHIP TO SAPS, WENRA REFERENCE LEVELS AND IAEA \nSAFETY STANDARDS ADDRESSED \n\nSAPS \nThis TAG provides guidance on SAPs ENM.1 to ENM.8 and their relationship \nwith other parts of the SAPs.  The SAPs in the ENM section specify control at \nincreasing levels of detail, starting at ENM.1 (highest level) with planning and \nthe management strategy for the site. ENM.2 then covers facilities and their \nsafety cases, ENM.3 covers the design, implementation and operation of those \nfacilities and ENM.4 covers the administration of those operations. The \ndesirable attributes of material in facilities are defined in principles ENM.5 and \n6. Finally, principles ENM.7 and ENM.8 are concerned with retrieval/inspection \nand accountancy of nuclear material. \n\nAdditional applications of this guidance include: fuel handling on research \nreactors, waste handling on power reactors and reprocessing activities. Nuclear \nmatter is subject to specific controls whilst in the core of a reactor [SAP ERC]. \nReactor coolant must also be controlled to prevent damage to the core [SAP \nEHT, ERC.3 and ESS para 340]. SAPs ENM.2-8 also apply to radioactive \nwaste and contaminated land where they present an equivalent hazard. For \nthese materials, principles in the sections on radioactive waste management \n[RW.1 to 7] and contaminated land also apply [RL.1 to 8].  \n\nWestern  European  Nuclear  Regulators  Association  (WENRA)  Reference \nlevels \nThere are no specific WENRA reference levels relevant to this TAG, although \nthose under Appendix E of the report of the Reactor Harmonisation Working \nGroup on the Design Basis Envelope for Existing Reactors [5] are relevant to \nthe associated engineering design provisions. The reference levels for Waste \nand Spent Fuel Storage are explicitly addressed in other TAGs (NS-TAST-GD-\n024 and NS-TAST-GD-081) but the advice given in this TAG is consistent with \nthis position. \n\n4.4 \n\nIAEA Standards \nThe concept of control in IAEA safety standards and guides covers all \nregulated radioactive material and not just nuclear material, but in general the \n\nReport  NS-TAST-GD-023 \nCM9 Ref: 2019/0250250 \n\nPage 4 of 14 \n\nOFFICIAL \n \n\n\fOffice for Nuclear Regulation  \n \n \n\nOFFICIAL \n\ncontrol of materials necessary for safety is not made explicitly in most IAEA \ndocuments. The Requirements Document on the Safety of Fuel Cycle Facilities \n[6] sets out relevant engineering design requirements and the Safety Guide \nwhich covers fire protection [7], provides relevant guidance where a failure to \ncontrol may lead to a fire or explosion hazard. \n\n5. \n\nADVICE TO INSPECTORS \n\n5.1 \n\n5.2 \n\n5.3 \n\n5.4 \n\nOverall strategy \nENM.1 states that a strategy should exist, to ensure that unwanted material is \nnot generated and that matter is controlled to prevent harm and to ensure \ncontrol can be maintained. The strategy should be consistent with current \nGovernment policy (such as Cmd. Paper 2919 and ref [8]) on such matters and \ncomply with relevant statutory and applicable provisions, including relevant \nLicence Conditions as outlined above. The strategy should be compatible with \nindividual safety cases and take a holistic view, especially with regard to \ninherent safety [EKP.1] [1]. The strategy should identify all routes for nuclear \nmaterial both into and out of the site or facility. The latter should also comply \nwith relevant legislation for transfers and disposals (the latter regulated by the \nEA and SEPA, see Annex 1 to the SAPs). The strategy should cover all \nrelevant nuclear material irrespective of whether it has been declared to be \nnuclear waste. \n\nThe strategy will take account of the lifetimes of plant and requirements for \ncontrol consistent with safety cases. The strategy or safety cases should \ndemonstrate any prolonged storage is safer than disposal, where a disposal \nroute is available. In some circumstances, the radioactive matter will present a \nhazard long after the current facilities have reached the end of their useful life. \nThe strategy should deal with this possibility and include appropriate \ncognisance of requirements during the \u201cperiod of responsibility\u201d [9] which may \napply long after a site or facility ceases normal operations. Finally, strategy \ndocuments should be live documents, taking account of changes to \ncircumstances. The following guidelines, together with other relevant SAPs \n[e.g. SC.6, DC.1 to 9], can be used in assessing this strategy. Some radioactive \nwaste is also nuclear matter and the principles in the SAPs sub-sections on \nRadioactive Waste and Contaminated Land could also be relevant.  \n\nManagement Control \nSAP ENM.2 covers control at the level of organisational control over activities \non a nuclear licensed site by a combination of engineered systems and \nmanagerial control procedures. The control will be justified in safety cases for \nall the relevant operations on the site, which define the safe operating envelope \nfor the material. \n\nAll activities involving nuclear matter are included and ENM.2 is not just \nrestricted to the processing of nuclear matter. Control must be exercised when \nraw nuclear materials or intermediates are stored or moved on a site, while \nnuclear material is being processed and after treatment, prior to transport off-\nsite for further treatment or disposal. There is no distinction between the \nstandards of control required for radioactive feedstock or radioactive waste. \nThe level of control will be related to the hazard, reliability demanded and the \nconsequences of loss of control of any such material on workers and others. \n\n5.5 \n\nIn order to control processes involving hazardous substances it is necessary to \nunderstand the objectives of the process, the limits and conditions required to \nmaintain safety and the physical and chemical properties of the substances \nbeing processed. \n\nReport  NS-TAST-GD-023 \nCM9 Ref: 2019/0250250 \n\nPage 5 of 14 \n\nOFFICIAL \n \n\n\fOffice for Nuclear Regulation  \n \n \n\n5.6 \n\n5.7 \n\n \n5.8 \n\n5.9 \n\nOFFICIAL \n\nThe need for control should be identified early in the safety case [particularly \nSC.3] and the SAPs specifically demand identification of faults leading to loss \nof control [FA.2]. \n\nThe safety case should review the options for process selection; to eliminate \nhazards by minimising the inventory [SAP EKP.1 & Para 152] or prevention \n(i.e. minimisation or reduction of the frequency of the fault) or by mitigation of \nthe consequences, in order of preference. This should be clearly identified in \nthe options studies that are carried out at the time of process selection and \nshould form part of the safety justification, usually at the preliminary stage. The \neffects of scale-up from experiments or different conditions during operation of \nearlier plant should be allowed for. There should be adequate provision to \nensure that under normal and fault conditions nuclear matter is: \n\n\uf0b7  Cooled,  monitored  and  controlled  where  the  heat  from  radioactive  decay  or \n\nchemical reaction may be significant;  \n\n\uf0b7  Managed  so  that  chemical  reactions,  radiolysis,  precipitation,  acidity  etc.  are \n\nkept within the specified limits (see ECH.1 \u2013 ECH.4); \n\n\uf0b7  Segregated appropriately [see ENM.5]. \n\nThe safety case should be developed (see [10]) through a structured analysis \n[SAP FA.2, EKP.4] including fault studies supported by probabilistic safety \nanalysis where appropriate, see ONR guidance [11] on \u201cDeterministic Safety \nAnalysis and the Use of Engineering Principles in Safety Assessment\u201d.  \n\nThe safety case should clearly identify the operating parameters [SAP-\nSC.6] which define the operating envelope and safety significant parameters \nwhich define the (LC 23) safety envelope and how each is derived; other ONR \nguidance applies. Specific consideration should be given to process transients \ndue to start-up, shutdown, maintenance and foreseeable faults [FA.6]. This is to \nensure that conditions during such phases are adequately covered by the \ncontrol / safety system or administrative procedures. Such consideration may \nindicate the requirement for additional control during these phases. \n\n5.10  Although the preference would be for passive then engineered control at all \n\ntimes, where this is not reasonably practicable, administrative safety measures \nmay suffice, see EKP.5. \n\n5.11 \n\nControl Features of Plant \nInventories should be low enough to avoid adverse effects due to runaway \nreactions and buffer storage should be sufficient to eliminate process \nperturbations with safety implications, as recognised by ENM.2. Buffer storage \nthat reduces sensitivity to faults should not be used for the prolonged storage of \nnuclear matter and its inventory of potentially harmful materials should be \nminimised consistent with the required functionality. There is a balance \nbetween achieving a robust process and minimising the inventory in buffer \nstorage. \n\n5.12  The site arrangements, layout and plant design should aim to avoid \n\nunnecessary movements of nuclear matter [EKP.3 and ELO.3] \n\n5.13  Occasions when it is necessary to temporarily re-route nuclear matter include \n\npressure relief and sampling. Continuous monitoring instrumentation may \nprovide necessary data but in certain circumstances samples of the actual \nmaterial may have to be taken. \n\nReport  NS-TAST-GD-023 \nCM9 Ref: 2019/0250250 \n\nPage 6 of 14 \n\nOFFICIAL \n \n\n\fOffice for Nuclear Regulation  \n \n \n\n5.14  Monitoring of plant parameters should rely as far as is practicable on \n\ninstrumentation that does not require nuclear matter to be diverted outside the \nmain containment. \n\nOFFICIAL \n\n5.15 \n\nIf samples are needed, adequate consideration should be given to ensuring \nthat samples are representative of the process to allow accurate measurement \n(ECH.4), whether or not routine control depends on the on-line or the off-line \ninstruments. Account should be taken of potential problems due to phase \nseparation, sample line deposition, condensation from gas streams, blockages, \ntemperature and chemical changes, which may affect the composition of the \nsample being taken. \n\n5.16  Where material must be re-routed, provision should be made to ensure the safe \n\nhandling of the material [ECV.3 and 4] and its return to safe containment by: \n\n1  Return to the process after use, or \n\n2  Treatment, or \n\n3  Storage, or \n\n4  Disposal. \n\n5.17  Whilst sampling should be avoided as a means for controlling dynamic \n\nsystems, it may still be necessary to periodically retrieve smaller amounts of \nmaterial over a longer timescale, in order to demonstrate compliance with a \nsafety case. Whilst ENM.3 discourages sampling as a means of controlling \ndynamic processes, ENM.7 is a reminder that some sampling from longer-term \nstorage may be necessary. \n\n5.18  Facilities should be designed in a way that facilitates bulk recovery of material \nbefore they reach the end of their operational or design life or earlier if required \nby site strategies [e.g.: ENM.1 & RW.1]. ENM.7 states that facilities should be \ndesigned and operated so that material can be retrieved within an appropriate \nperiod of time, including intervention in the event of unexpected faults, \naccidents or degradation of packaging. (See also SAP-RW.5.) \n\n5.19  The scope of SAP ENM.3 is broad; including not only systems for materials \n\naccountancy but also the design and operation of the facilities that control \nnuclear matter. Essentially, it builds on ENM.2 by considering the systems \nneeded to provide control. \n\n5.20 \n\nIn some cases, adequate control may depend on the use of robust and \nauditable operating instructions and procedures.  Accountancy measurements \nmay provide further support. There is ONR guidance [12] on centralised \nsystems to monitor materials movements and process conditions. \n\n5.21  The fundamental principles SAP EKP.1 to 5 are relevant to design and \n\noperation of processes controlling nuclear matter. ONR expects systems \nproviding safety functions to possess appropriate levels of redundancy, \ndiversity and segregation from systems used for normal control [EDR.2], see \nONR guidance on functional safety systems [12].  It should be shown that \nsafety-related components can be operated and controlled within a safe \noperating envelope throughout their operating life. The parameters of the \nenvelope should be consistent with the type of construction, potential modes of \nfailure and operational considerations. \n\n5.22  Monitoring and recording systems are necessary to detect problems that may \ndevelop in processes due to leakage, changes in temperature, chemical \n\nReport  NS-TAST-GD-023 \nCM9 Ref: 2019/0250250 \n\nPage 7 of 14 \n\nOFFICIAL \n \n\n\fOffice for Nuclear Regulation  \n \n \n\nOFFICIAL \n\nreaction and other effects.  The ESR and ESS sections of SAPs expand on the \nrequirements for these systems. As well as leakage, effects including \nsegregation, deposition and condensation can cause problems, see ENM.8. \n\n5.23  Where practicable, safety systems, safety-related instrumentation and \n\nengineered controls should be designed to fail-safe. Failure should be revealed \nto the operator by alarms or other means. There may be a requirement for high \nlevels of redundancy and diversity dependent on the reliability of each system. \nThe problems associated with single failure criteria should be considered \n[EDR.4]. \n\n5.24  The maintenance requirements of any monitoring and control equipment should \n\nbe clearly identified [LC28] and in accordance with the arrangements made \nunder the licence conditions. These should include calibration and ensure that \nthe control system is always available when required. Similar maintenance is \nrequired for safety systems and safety related instrumentation [13] and this is \naddressed by ONR guidance. \n\nAttributes of Nuclear Material \n\n5.25  ENM.5 and 6 outline physical and chemical characteristics that nuclear material \nshould possess, for control to be achievable. Together with the process \ncharacteristics, these determine the precautions that need to be taken to \nensure adequate control arrangements are in place. These should be \ndocumented e.g.: in flowsheets, safety functional requirements and the basis of \ndesign. These documents should be identified in the safety case. Such \ninformation will help to define the safety envelope within which the process is \nmanaged. \n\n5.26 \n\nIn some circumstances the identification and quantification of the materials \nbeing handled may not be possible. When this is the case, the arrangements \nshould allow for the level of uncertainty and identify additional levels of control \nto maintain safety margins as required by the safety analysis. \n\n5.27  Arrangements should be made and implemented (which may include \n\nexamination, testing and auditing) to ensure that incoming material meets the \nacceptance criteria.  Arrangements should also be established for the safe \nmanagement of any incoming material that fails to meet the acceptance criteria.  \n\n5.28  Segregation in SAP paragraph 789 includes segregation both from \n\nincompatible materials and according to physical and chemical form, \nflammability, specific radioactivity, half-life, fissile nature and type of radiation \nemitted where subsequent storage, processing, conditioning and disposal \nwould otherwise be adversely affected. \n\n5.29  Passively safe conditions for storage should be used where reasonably \n\npracticable. Storage of material in a passively safe state still requires a safety \ncase that identifies operational limits and conditions required for safety. Many of \nthe paragraphs in SAP RW.5 also apply to ENM.6 and 7 for nuclear material. \nWhere fissile material is present, no external controls should be relied upon to \nprevent criticality, see ECR.1 and ECR.2.  The safety case should demonstrate \nacceptable sub-criticality margins for stores taking account of the uncertainties \nthat may exist. Relevant factors may include: \n\n\uf0b7 \n\n\uf0b7 \n\nform of the material; \n\nenvironmental  conditions, \ncontaminants; \n\nOFFICIAL \n \n\nincluding \n\ntemperature,  humidity,  and \n\nReport  NS-TAST-GD-023 \nCM9 Ref: 2019/0250250 \n\nPage 8 of 14 \n\n\fOffice for Nuclear Regulation  \n \n \n\n\uf0b7 \n\n\uf0b7 \n\n\uf0b7 \n\n \n\n5.30 \n\nheat generation (from individual items and the whole store); \n\nOFFICIAL \n\ngas generation (pressurisation, flammable mixtures, deformation); and \n\nradiological  hazards,  taking  account  of  on-site  storage  and  long  term \nmanagement, which may include disposal. \n\nIn some circumstances, the inherent safety characteristics of the process \nreduce the potential hazard such that the control arrangements can be \nappropriately simplified. \n\nAccountancy & Display Systems \n\n5.31  Principle ENM.4 expects records of nuclear matter to be generated and kept, \n\nthis is also a fundamental Safeguards requirement in the case of qualifying \nnuclear material. ENM.8 requires this information to be processed and \nanalysed in a timely manner in order to prevent any significant deviations from \nenvironmental, security or safety case criteria. \n\n5.32  The arrangements for monitoring and relaying control and safety information to \n\nrelevant staff should be clearly identified in the safety case. Thus the safety \ncase should specify the periodicity of gathering and displaying such data. \nDisplay systems should be configured to provide an overview of the condition of \nthe process including, where appropriate, mass and volumetric balance \nsummaries. \n\n5.33  Where plant safety must be maintained by appropriate and timely response to \n\nsystem alarms [EHF.7], the response should be automatic where reasonably \npracticable; however, where it is not, proportionate robust managerial control \nshould be exercised. \n\n5.34  The actions to be taken on failure of safety systems, safety related \n\ninstrumentation and engineered control equipment should be clearly identified \nin the safety case and in instructions to workers. This advice should be \nincorporated in any on-site, off-site emergency or contingency instructions. In \nsome circumstances the safety case may have to consider the need for local \nfield control stations for normal control and in the event that the main control \ncentre is not tenable. \n\nReport  NS-TAST-GD-023 \nCM9 Ref: 2019/0250250 \n\nPage 9 of 14 \n\nOFFICIAL \n \n\n\fOffice for Nuclear Regulation  \n \n \n\n6. \n\nREFERENCES \n\n \n\nOFFICIAL \n\n1.

To  avoid  over-regulation  in  areas  where \nparliament did not intend, the legislation also specifies a number of exceptions \nto  terms  such  as  nuclear  matter.  Whilst  this  may  seem  complicated,  such \ndifferences  rarely  impact  on  the  work  of  nuclear  inspection  because  there  is \nconsiderable  consistency \nthe  main \ndistinguishing features and exceptions to the legislation. \n\nin  practice.  This  appendix  covers \n\nA1.4  The  1960  Paris  Convention  on  nuclear  liability  uses  the  terms  \u201cnuclear  fuel\u201d \nand \u201cradioactive product or waste\u201d and seeks to identify responsibilities and \n\nReport  NS-TAST-GD-023 \nCM9 Ref: 2019/0250250 \n\nPage 12 of 14 \n\nOFFICIAL \n \n\n\fOffice for Nuclear Regulation  \n \n \n\nOFFICIAL \n\nliabilities  damage  caused  by  occurrences  involving  such  material.

For definitions \nof  terms  such  as  \u201crelevant  foreign  operator\u201d,  \u201cradiation  practice\u201d  etc., \ninspectors are referred to the source legislation. \n\nA1.7  The  definition  of  \u201cRadioactive  Substance\u201d \n\nin \n\nthe \n\nIonising  Radiation \n\nRegulations (2017) is a much broader term than \u201cNuclear Matter\u201d. \n\nA1.8        Under  IRR17,  where  a  radioactive  substance  is  used  in  a  practice,  (where  a \npractice  means  work  involving  the  production,  processing,  handling,  disposal, \nuse, storage, holding or transport of radioactive substances), its activity should \nnever be disregarded for the purposes of radiation protection where the activity \nconcentrations exceed specified values as defined in the regulations.  If further \ninformation is required regarding the interpretation of IRR17, please refer to an \nONR radiation protection specialist inspector. \n\nA1.9  The  term  \u201csealed  source\u201d  means  a  source  containing  any  radioactive \nsubstance  whose  structure  is  such  as  to  prevent,  under  normal  conditions  of \nuse, any dispersion of radioactive substances into the environment, but it does \nnot  include  any  radioactive  substance  inside  a  nuclear  reactor  or  any  nuclear \nfuel element. \n\nA1.10  Nuclear Safeguards legislation defines nuclear material as fissionable material, \nsource material or ore.

The outcome of an assessment by \nONR is to reach an independent and informed judgement on the adequacy of a \nnuclear safety case [2]. The principles presented in the SAPs are supported by a suite \nof guidance to further assist ONR\u2019s Inspectors in their technical assessment work in \nsupport of making regulatory judgements and decisions. This Technical Assessment \nGuide (TAG) is one such guide [3]. \n\n2. \n\nPURPOSE AND SCOPE \n\nThis TAG provides guidance to ONR Inspectors to advise and inform their regulatory \njudgements in relation to decommissioning at nuclear licensed sites. The TAG \nsupplements the guidance in the SAPs [1], in particular principles DC.1 to DC.9 on \ndecommissioning. The TAG has been written with due cognisance of relevant \nInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) safety standards for the decommissioning \nof nuclear facilities [4] and the Western European Nuclear Regulators\u2019 Association \n(WENRA) Safety Reference Levels (SRL) for decommissioning [5]. \n\nDuty holders may refer to the TAG as a source of good practice, although the TAG \nshould not be interpreted as a set of prescriptive legal requirements. \n\nThe IAEA defines decommissioning as, \u201cthe administrative and technical actions taken \nto remove all or some of the regulatory controls from an authorised facility so the \nfacility and its site can be reused\u201d [6]. For the purposes of this guidance, delivery of \ndecommissioning is assumed to start on cessation of operations and continues until \nthe defined end-state has been demonstrably achieved. \n\nIn the UK, decommissioning is carried out under the same legislative framework as the \npreceding steps in the lifecycle. The general legal duties and principles of nuclear \nsafety, control of nuclear matter, radiological protection and conventional safety \ncontinue to apply to decommissioning. Consequently, the general advice provided in \nother TAGs continues to be relevant when a plant enters into decommissioning. This \nTAG focusses on the specific factors that are particularly important to consider in \ndecommissioning, with references to the general advice where appropriate. \n\nLicensees may assign particular terms to stages of decommissioning, such as Post \nOperational Clean Out (POCO), Care and Maintenance (C&M), Surveillance and \nMaintenance (S&M) and Final Site Clearance. As ONR\u2019s objectives in regulating \ndecommissioning are outcome-focussed, this TAG is not prescriptive in respect of the \nterminology licensees may use. However, it is important for a licensee to provide clear \ndefinitions of the terms it applies, to ensure a common understanding of the intended \napproach amongst both its own staff and other stakeholders. \n\n3. \n\nRELATIONSHIP TO LICENCE AND OTHER RELEVANT LEGISLATION \n\nLicence Conditions \n\n3.1 \n\nAll 36 standard Licence Conditions (LCs) [7] apply during decommissioning and are \nrelevant to activities involving decommissioning on nuclear licensed sites. However, a \nnumber of LCs are of particular relevance: \n\n\uf06e \n\uf06e \n\uf06e \n\uf06e \n\n4 \n6 \n15 \n17 \n\nControl of nuclear matter \nDocuments, records, authorities and certificates \nPeriodic review \nManagement systems \n\n \n \n\nNS-TAST-GD-026 Revision 5  \nRef: 2019/144943  \n\nPage 3 of 31 \n\n\fOffice for Nuclear Regulation  \n \n \n\n3.2 \n\n3.3 \n\n3.4 \n\n3.6 \n\n3.7 \n\n\uf06e \n\uf06e \n\uf06e \n\uf06e \n\uf06e \n\uf06e \n\uf06e \n\uf06e \n\uf06e \n\uf06e \n\n18 \n22 \n23 \n25 \n28 \n32 \n33 \n34 \n35 \n36 \n\nRadiological protection \nModifications \nOperating rules \nOperational records \nExamination, inspection, maintenance and testing \nAccumulation of radioactive waste \nDisposal of radioactive waste \nLeakage and escape of radioactive material and radioactive waste \nDecommissioning \nOrganisational capability \n\nIn addition to NIA65, the licensee must continue to comply with all other relevant \nstatutory provisions arising under the Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974 and \nsubordinate legislation, including the Ionising Radiations Regulations 2017, Lifting \nOperations and Lifting Equipment Regulations 1998, and Control of Asbestos \nRegulations 2012. Some particularly important legislation in the context of \ndecommissioning is highlighted below. \n\nNuclear Reactors (Environmental Impact Assessment for Decommissioning) \nRegulations 1999 (EIADR) \n\nEIADR applies to decommissioning of all nuclear reactors that had a continuous \nthermal load above 1kW whose decommissioning started after the regulations came \ninto force on 19th November 1999. \n\nEIADR can also apply to reactor decommissioning projects that commenced prior to \n19th November 1999, in the event of a change or extension to the project that may \nhave a significant adverse environmental impact. In the event of such a change, the \nlicensee must apply to ONR for a determination as to whether a new environmental \nimpact assessment is required and if so, the regulations apply thereon. \n\n3.5 \n\nSpecific guidance on EIADR is available at www.onr.org.uk/eiadr  \n\nIonising Radiations Regulations 2017 \n\nThe Ionising Radiations Regulations 2017 (IRR17) apply to the use of ionising \nradiation in the workplace, with the intent of restricting exposure and limiting dose to \nthe workforce and the public and apply throughout the lifecycle of a nuclear facility. \n\nRadiological protection has particular importance during decommissioning, due to the \nrange of activities undertaken, inherent uncertainties and personnel entries into \ncontrolled areas when systems that provided protection during the operational phase \nhave been retired. Specific regulations of particular relevance to decommissioning \ninclude, but are not limited to: \n\n\uf06e \n\uf06e \n\uf06e \n\nRegulation 8  (radiation risk assessments) \nRegulation 9   (restriction of exposure) \nRegulation 12  (dose limitation) \n\n3.8 \n\nFurther guidance is provided in NS-TAST-GD-038 (Radiological Protection) [3] and the \nApproved Code of Practice [8]. \n\nConstruction Design and Management Regulations 2015 (CDM) \n\n3.9 \n\nDecommissioning typically gives rise to significant challenges of a conventional safety \nnature, such as working at height, work in confined spaces, work with high \ntemperatures, demolition of civil structures and export of large heavy items. \n\n3.10  The CDM regulations provide the main legislative requirements in respect of the \n\nmanagement of health, safety and welfare during construction projects. The relevance \n\nNS-TAST-GD-026 Revision 5  \nRef: 2019/144943  \n\nPage 4 of 31 \n\n \n \n\n\fOffice for Nuclear Regulation  \n \n \n\nof CDM to decommissioning is derived from the CDM definition of \u2018construction work\u2019 \nwhich includes: \n\n\uf06e \n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\nThe decommissioning, demolition or dismantling of a structure \nRemoval of a structure, or of any product or waste resulting from demolition or \ndismantling of a structure, or from disassembly of prefabricated elements which \nimmediately before such disassembly formed such a structure; \nRemoval of mechanical, electrical, gas, compressed air, hydraulic, \ntelecommunications, computer or similar services which are normally fixed \nwithin or to a structure \n\n3.11  Specific guidance on CDM is available at www.hse.gov.uk/pubns/books/l153  \n\nEnvironmental Legislation \n\n3.12  Decommissioning results in significant quantities of radioactive wastes, which then \n\nneed to be managed to the point of disposal. \n\n3.13  The relevant environmental regulator \u2013 the Environment Agency (EA) in England, the \n\nScottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) in Scotland, or Natural Resources \nWales (NRW) in Wales \u2013 have responsibility for permitting the disposal of radioactive \nand non-radioactive wastes arising from site activities, and for regulating the site \nagainst the corresponding permit limits and conditions. \n\n3.14 \n\nInspectors on sites undertaking decommissioning should familiarise themselves with \nONR\u2019s Memoranda of Understanding with the environmental regulators [9] and \nsupporting guidance [10], as well as the joint guidance document, \u201cBasic Principles of \nRadioactive Waste Management\u201d [11]. \n\n4. \n\n4.1 \n\nRELATIONSHIP TO SAPS, WENRA REFERENCE LEVELS AND IAEA SAFETY \nSTANDARDS ADDRESSED \n\nThe SAPs [1] provide ONR\u2019s nuclear inspectors with a framework for making \nconsistent regulatory judgements on the safety of activities, and include the legal duty \nto reduce risk so far as is reasonably practicable (SFAIRP). The SAPs are split into \nsections relating to different aspects of nuclear safety. One section of the SAPs is \ndedicated to decommissioning and those principles are summarised here: \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\nDC.1 \u2013 this principle relates to consideration of decommissioning during the \nplanning, design construction and operation of a new facility, or modification to \nan existing facility to facilitate safe decommissioning. \nDC.2 \u2013 this principle relates to preparation and maintenance of a \ndecommissioning strategy that is appropriately integrated with other relevant \nstrategies. \nDC.3 \u2013 this principle relates to timing of decommissioning and justification of \nthe continuing safety of the facility for the period prior to its decommissioning, \nwith identification of any necessary remedial and operational measures to \nreduce the risk where this cannot be underpinned. \nDC.4 \u2013 this principle relates to preparation of a decommissioning plan that sets \nout how the facility will be safely decommissioned. \nDC.5 \u2013 this principle relates to facilities being passively safe before entering a \ncare and maintenance phase. \nDC.6 \u2013 this principle relates to identification, preparation, update, retention and \nownership of documents and records required for decommissioning purposes. \nDC.7 \u2013 this principle relates to arrangements for establishing and maintaining \nthe decommissioning organisation to ensure safe and effective \ndecommissioning. \n\nNS-TAST-GD-026 Revision 5  \nRef: 2019/144943  \n\nPage 5 of 31 \n\n \n \n\n\f\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\nOffice for Nuclear Regulation  \n \n \n\nDC.8 \u2013 this principle relates to periodic review and modification to the \nmanagement system prior to and during decommissioning. \nDC.9 \u2013 this principle relates to preparation of the decommissioning safety case \nto demonstrate the safety of the decommissioning plan and its associated \ndecommissioning activities, which is to be kept up to date as the work \nprogresses. \n\n4.2 \n\nIn addition to principles DC.1-DC.9, the following may also be of relevance to \ndecommissioning assessments: \n\nRW.1 to RW.7 \u2013 these principles relate to the management of radioactive \nwaste at all stages of the lifecycle of a facility. \nRP.1 to RP.7 \u2013 these principles relate to radiation protection and control of \nareas to limit spread of radioactive contamination. \nMS.1 to MS.4 \u2013 these principles relate to effective leadership and management \nwhich is crucial to maintain during decommissioning which is a dynamic state \nleading to progressive reduction in resource on the site. \nEAD.2 \u2013 this principle relates to provision of adequate margins to allow for \nageing and degradation of SSCs. \nEMT.2 \u2013 this principle relates to frequency of examination, inspection, \nmaintenance and testing of SSCs, which may need re-examination during \ndecommissioning. \nECE.26 \u2013 this principle relates to consideration of decommissioning at the \ndesign stage to ensure incorporation of features to facilitate decommissioning. \nRL.1 to RL.9 \u2013 these principles relate to land quality management which will \nlikely become more prominent as decommissioning progresses towards final \nsite clearance and release from regulatory control. \nFP.1 to FP.8 \u2013 these are the fundamental principles which underpin the SAPs \nand outline ONR\u2019s expectations regarding responsibility, leadership and \nmanagement for safety, optimisation of protection measures, safety \nassessment, limitation of risks to individuals and protection of present and \nfuture generations. \n\n4.3 \n\n4.4 \n\n4.5 \n\nThe SAPs form a complete document and Inspectors should consider them as a \nwhole. Inspectors are advised to base their judgements not only on the \ndecommissioning principles (DC.1 - DC.9) and the additional SAPs suggested above, \nbut to consider the specific case under assessment and which other SAPs and \nassociated TAGs may be relevant. \n\nThis TAG therefore provides advice to inform assessments of licensees\u2019 early \nconsiderations of decommissioning, in addition to the practical delivery of \ndecommissioning that takes place after operations have ceased. \n\nNS-TAST-GD-005 [3] identifies the Western European Nuclear Regulators' Association \n(WENRA) Safety Reference Levels (SRL) as a source of Relevant Good Practice \n(RGP) for operating reactors, facilities in decommissioning and facilities for storage of \nradioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel. This TAG has therefore been benchmarked \nagainst the Decommissioning SRLs [5] and the guidance in Section 5 is structured in \naccordance with the SRL topic areas: \n\n\uf06e \n\uf06e \n\uf06e \n\uf06e \n\nSafety Management System  (SRLs D-01 to D-14) \nDecommissioning Strategy and Planning  (SRLs D-15 to D-29) \nConduct of Decommissioning  (SRLs D-30 to D-49) \nSafety Verification  (SRLs D-50 to D-62) \n\n4.6 \n\nThe most relevant IAEA [4] documents to decommissioning are: \n\n\uf06e \n\nFundamental Safety Principles (SF-1) \n\n \n \n\nNS-TAST-GD-026 Revision 5  \nRef: 2019/144943  \n\nPage 6 of 31 \n\n\fOffice for Nuclear Regulation  \n \n \n\n\uf06e \n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\uf06e \n\nDecommissioning of facilities (GSR part 6) \nSafety Assessment for the Decommissioning of Facilities Using Radioactive \nMaterial (WS-G-5.2) \nDecommissioning of Nuclear Power Plants, Research Reactors and Other \nNuclear Fuel Cycle Facilities (SSG-47) \nDecommissioning of Medical, Industrial and Research Facilities (SSG-49) \nApplication of the Concepts of Exclusion, Exemption and Clearance (RS-G-1.7) \n\n5. \n\nADVICE TO INSPECTORS \n\nSAFETY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM   \n\nResponsibility during decommissioning (WENRA SRLs D-01 \u2013 D-04) \n\n5.1 \n\nThe site licensee retains prime responsibility for safety throughout the lifetime of \nfacilities and activities. This responsibility cannot be delegated, as stated in SAP FP.1 \n[1]. This fundamental principle applies equally to decommissioning as it does to \noperations, therefore licensees are expected develop their organisation, resource \nlevels, capabilities, strategies and administrative arrangements to ensure safety \nthroughout the entire lifecycle. \n\n5.2  When a facility enters decommissioning the licensee may need to broaden its base of \ndecommissioning skills, knowledge and capability, which may result in an increase in \ndeployment of specialist contractors. Inspectors should refer to NS-TAST-GD-049 \n(Licensee use of contractors and intelligent customer capability) [3] for general \nguidance and note the relevant requirements of the CDM Regulations, especially the \nresponsibilities of the nominated Client and Principal Designer. \n\n5.3 \n\n5.4 \n\n5.5 \n\n5.6 \n\nAt all times, the licensee must ensure that it has sufficient in-house expertise and \nresource to manage and make informed decisions on issues affecting nuclear safety, \nand be able to demonstrate that it is an intelligent customer for any bought-in items or \nservices as well as exercising adequate control and supervision of contractors working \non the licensed site. \n\nDecommissioning can give rise to new safety challenges, which might require pre-\nexisting systems to be augmented or reconfigured (e.g. ventilation). Inspectors should \nbe mindful that delivery of decommissioning often requires elements of construction \nwork and modifications to the existing plant, including the identification and \nmanagement of any asbestos containing materials. Decommissioning arrangements \ntherefore need to link with all relevant arrangements made under licence conditions \nother than LC35, for example LC22 (Modification or Experiment on Existing Plant). \n\nThe UK Government expects all nuclear operators should take the steps necessary to \nensure that adequate funds are in place to meet their decommissioning liabilities. \nWhilst ONR does not directly regulate financial provisions, ONR provides advice to \nother organisations and the government on the adequacy of the plans on which the \nfinancial provisions are based. Further information is provided in Appendix 1. \n\nOrganisational Structure (WENRA SRLs D-5 \u2013 D-8) \n\nA licensee should retain adequate suitably qualified and experienced personnel \n(SQEP) to ensure nuclear safety throughout the full range of its business. In general \nthis is achieved by developing a Nuclear Baseline, against which ONR\u2019s overall \nexpectations can be found in NS-TAST-GD-65 (Function and Content of the Nuclear \nBaseline) [3]. \n\n5.7 \n\nDecommissioning gives rise to cultural challenges with potential to undermine \nworkforce morale, such as a high rate of staff turnover, loss of operational knowledge, \nwidespread changes in role, a need to develop new skills, loss of employment, \n\nNS-TAST-GD-026 Revision 5  \nRef: 2019/144943  \n\nPage 7 of 31 \n\n \n \n\n\fOffice for Nuclear Regulation  \n \n \n\nincreasing use of contractors and a constantly changing workface environment. It is \ntherefore important for licensees to maintain a robust safety culture to underwrite the \nincreased reliance on human performance that typically occurs when a plant \ntransitions into decommissioning. \n\n5.8 \n\nInspectors should also refer to SAPs MS.1 to MS.4 [1] and TAGs NS-TAST-GD-061 \n(Staffing levels and task organisation), NS-TAST-GD-048 (Organisational capability) \nand NS-TAST-GD-080 (Challenge Culture, Independent Challenge Capability \n(including an Internal Regulation function) and the Provision of Nuclear Safety Advice) \n[3 for general guidance. \n\n5.9 \n\nInspectors may consider whether a licensee\u2019s organisational structure is robust to the \nchallenges that typically occur in respect of decommissioning, such as: \n\n5.10  The licensee\u2019s organisational structure should clearly identify: \n\n\uf06e \n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\uf06e \n\uf06e \n\uf06e \n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\nLoss of operational knowledge \nQuantification and retention of sufficient in-house resources, at a time of \nuncertain future employment prospects \nManagement of uncertainties \nPressures to achieve rapid hazard reduction \nRequirements for new skills, to progress decommissioning projects \nA need for greater flexibility as the workface undergoes significant change \nIncreased reliance on administrative measures to deliver safety and a reduced \nextent of engineered protection \nEnsuring the licensee\u2019s Nuclear Safety Committee exercises sufficient \nindependent challenge of the overall decommissioning strategy in addition to \nscrutinising individual activities \n\nResponsibilities for ensuring decommissioning is conducted safely \nAn intelligent customer capability for decommissioning wherever reliance is \nplaced on contractors \nRecognition of the increased prevalence of conventional health and safety risks \nas decommissioning progresses \nRecognition of the importance of maintaining radiological protection standards \nthroughout decommissioning \nPriorities for hazard reduction, which should be based on addressing the \nhighest hazards and risks in a timely manner \nProject management arrangements, noting the scale and nature of \ndecommissioning projects may vary considerably from those in the operational \nphase \nA reporting hierarchy, to allow any conflicts that could compromise safety \nduring decommissioning to be resolved  \nAdequate integration of all parts of the licensee\u2019s organisation that contribute to \ndecommissioning and management of the resulting wastes \n\n5.11 \n\nInspectors may consider whether the licensee\u2019s organisational structure is sufficiently \nflexible to ensure safety as the anticipated progressive (and often rapid) change in \nplant status occurs during decommissioning, noting this should allow a precautionary \napproach to any inherent uncertainties. \n\n5.12 \n\nInspectors should also seek assurance that the licensee maintains adequate focus on \nthe following throughout decommissioning: \n\n\uf06e \n\uf06e \n\nIts leadership function, to provide adequate direction and oversight. \nAn internal challenge function is sustained and appropriate to \ndecommissioning. \n\nNS-TAST-GD-026 Revision 5  \nRef: 2019/144943  \n\nPage 8 of 31 \n\n \n \n\n\fOffice for Nuclear Regulation  \n \n \n\n\uf06e \n\nSafety culture, to identify signs of deterioration (e.g. patterns of events or near-\nmisses) and measures to address this should it be identified. \n\nRecord and Knowledge Keeping (WENRA SRLs D-9 & D-10) \n\n5.13  Licensees are required to make adequate provision for recording and preserving all the \n\ndata and information that may be required in the future to ensure safe \ndecommissioning on nuclear licensed sites for as long as such information may be \nrequired. \n\n5.14 \n\nIt is particularly important for licensees to recognise the value to decommissioning of \naccurate information on nuclear facilities, their radioactive inventory and the Systems, \nStructures and Components (SSCs) that contribute to safety. Licensees should ensure \nthis data is kept up-to-date and maintained in a readily available format, which should \nalign with the relevant decommissioning strategy and plan. In considering the scope of \ninformation to be retained, licensees should be cognisant of the unique objectives of \ndecommissioning and how delivery of those objectives may drive different information \nneeds to those of the operational phase. \n\n5.15  LC 6 requires licensees to make adequate records to demonstrate compliance with \n\neach condition of the site licence, and to ensure that such records are preserved for a \nfurther 30 years. LC 25 requires licensees to ensure that adequate records are made a \nkept of the operation, inspection and maintenance of nuclear facilities, which will \ninclude the decommissioning phase of the lifecycle of a facility. \n\n5.16  The record preservation period of 30 years reflects the requirements of NIA65 with \n\nrespect to third party liability. This period starts from the time when decommissioning \nor decontamination of the plant is complete and all radioactive waste has been \ntransferred to another location or disposed of. \n\n5.17 \n\nInspectors should seek evidence that licensees have put arrangements in place to \nensure knowledge of its facilities and inventory are maintained in a secure and \naccessible form, noting the potentially long timescales over which decommissioning \ncan take place. \n\n5.18  For general guidance, Inspectors should refer to NS-TAST-GD-027 (Training and \n\nassuring personnel competence), NS-TAST-GD-79 (Licensee design authority \ncapability), NS TAST-GD-061 (Staffing levels and task organisation) and NS-TAST-\nGD-033 (Dutyholder management of records) [3. \n\n5.19  The joint ONR/EA/SEPA/NRW guidance on management of higher activity radioactive \nwastes [12] provides further guidance on managing information and records relating to \nradioactive waste, some of which may be relevant to decommissioning.  \n\n5.20 \n\nInspectors should confirm that the licensee has recognised the need to capture \ninformation of relevance to decommissioning, starting from the design stage and \ncontinuing through the whole life-cycle.

Inspectors should be aware that a significant radiological \nrelease may require amendment to the extant decommissioning strategy or undermine \nthe ability of a site to meet the previously assumed end state. \n\n5.25  The arrangements for controlling any modifications to the decommissioning strategy, \nmethodology, programme or procedures should include an assessment of the safety \nimplications associated with any such changes. \n\nDECOMMISSIONING STRATEGY AND PLANNING   \n\nFacilitating decommissioning during design, construction and operational phase \n(WENRA SRLs D-15 & D-16) \n\n5.26  The requirements for decommissioning should be considered at all phases in the \noverall lifecycle of the facility, starting at the planning and design phase. \n\n5.27  Although the practical delivery of decommissioning is the last stage of a nuclear \n\nfacility\u2019s lifecycle, planning and preparation for decommissioning should occur with an \nappropriate level of detail from the moment design commences. \n\n5.28  Targeted consideration of decommissioning during the preceding lifecycle stages can \nsignificantly reduce the risks and costs of delivering decommissioning. Throughout the \nsteps of design, construction, commissioning, maintenance and operation, the \nevaluation of options should consider the potential impacts on future decommissioning \n\u2013 licensees should take the opportunity to reduce the challenges and risks of future \ndecommissioning wherever it is reasonably practicable to do so. \n\n5.29  Licensees should take steps to secure a smooth transition out of the operational phase \n\ninto decommissioning, which firstly requires development of a clear and \ncomprehensive decommissioning strategy and plan. The safety case should be \nproactively managed, initially to avoid breaches of operating rules and the \nmaintenance schedule as plant runs down. Adequate safety margins will need to be \nsustained as the engineered systems that provided protection during the operational \nphase are taken out of service and removed. Decommissioning can also require \n\nNS-TAST-GD-026 Revision 5  \nRef: 2019/144943  \n\nPage 10 of 31 \n\n \n \n\n\fOffice for Nuclear Regulation  \n \n \n\ndevelopment of new capabilities, such as large-scale waste stores, an enhanced \nscope of characterisation and a process of exemption and clearance to address large \nvolumes of demolition waste and spoil. \n\n5.30  Therefore before entering into decommissioning, licensees should carefully consider \n\nthe choreography between; cessation of operations; characterisation of the facility and \nits inventory; removal of the inventory; a precautionary approach to any inherent \nuncertainties; determination of the target end state and any preceding interim states, \nand; deployment of reasonably practicable measures to ensure the safety of workers \nas decommissioning tasks are delivered. \n\n5.31  National and international experience has shown that many of the challenges and risks \n\nof decommissioning legacy nuclear facilities could have been significantly reduced or \navoided, had the initial design and operational philosophy given greater thought to the \nneeds of future decommissioning. \n\n5.32 \n\nIn the case of new facilities, Inspectors should check that the licensee\u2019s arrangements \nand processes recognise the need to challenge the design in order to reduce the risks \nof future decommissioning to as low as reasonably practicable (ALARP).

Baseline surveys should consider both \nsurface and subsurface conditions as well as groundwater. For existing sites without \nsuch survey data, then data from analogous, undisturbed areas with similar \ncharacteristics should be used. \n\nNS-TAST-GD-026 Revision 5  \nRef: 2019/144943  \n\nPage 11 of 31 \n\n \n \n\n\fOffice for Nuclear Regulation  \n \n \n\nDecommissioning strategy (WENRA SRLs D-17 & D-18) \n\n5.35  Each UK nuclear operator is expected to produce and maintain a decommissioning \n\nstrategy and plan for each site it is responsible for. Such strategies and plans should \ntake into account the views of stakeholders (including relevant local authorities and the \npublic). The strategy should be to a level of detail commensurate with the type and \nstatus of the facility, the hazards presented and the stage in the lifecycle. \n\n5.36  Strategies should consider all \u2018relevant factors\u2019, presenting them in a transparent way \nand demonstrating objectively how each has been reflected in the adopted approach. \nExamples of \u2018relevant factors\u2019 are listed in UK government policy and include: \n\n\uf06e \n\uf06e \n\uf06e \n\uf06e \n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\uf06e \n\uf06e \n\uf06e \n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\nEnsuring worker and public safety. \nMaintaining site security. \nMinimising the generation of radioactive wastes. \nEffective and safe management of the radioactive wastes that are created. \nMinimising environmental impacts including reusing or recycle materials \nwhenever practicable. \nMaintaining adequate site stewardship. \nUsing resources effectively, efficiently and economically. \nProviding adequate funding. \nMaintaining access to an adequate skills and knowledge base. \nConducting research and development (R&D) to develop necessary knowledge \nor capability. \nConsulting appropriate public and stakeholder groups on the options \nconsidered and the contents of the strategy. \n\n5.37  The future intended use of the site is a significant factor in determining the scope and \n\nend state for decommissioning.  \n\n5.38 \n\n5.39 \n\nInspectors should be aware of relevant government strategies and policies, in \nconjunction with this TAG and other regulatory expectations, when considering the \nadequacy of a licensee\u2019s decommissioning strategy. Although ONR does not enforce \ngovernment policy, inspectors should regulate in accordance with the framework of \ngovernment policy whilst ensuring that national law and regulatory requirements are \nmet.  \n\nInspectors should assess whether the licensee\u2019s decommissioning strategy is \nconsistent with relevant national policies and strategies. Management of radioactive \nwastes and nuclear decommissioning are devolved matters, so government policy can \nvary between England, Scotland and Wales. Licensees should identify and justify any \ndifferences. \n\n5.40  The licensee is expected to review its strategies periodically, and in response to any \n\nsignificant change in circumstances. An up-to-date decommissioning strategy is an \nestablished regulatory expectation of a robust periodic review of safety (NS-TAST-GD-\n050 and SRL D72).  \n\n5.41 \n\nInspectors should consider whether the licensee\u2019s decommissioning strategies, \nprogrammes and plans adequately demonstrate a systematic and progressive \nreduction of hazard. This does not mean that hazards must reduce year on year, but \nthat in the long term hazards progressively reduce to a level where decommissioning \ncan be considered complete in terms of reaching the defined end state for the relevant \nfacility or site. \n\nNS-TAST-GD-026 Revision 5  \nRef: 2019/144943  \n\nPage 12 of 31 \n\n \n \n\n\fOffice for Nuclear Regulation  \n \n \n\n5.42 \n\nInspectors should consider whether the strategy is sufficiently integrated at facility and \nsite levels, if and when appropriate, for example:  \n\nThe decommissioning strategy should be linked to, or integrated with, the \nstrategy for the management of existing radioactive waste from the site(s) and \nradioactive waste that will be produced during decommissioning.   \nKey interactions and interdependences are taken into account within the \nplanning process, e.g. any shared reliance on equipment, services and \ninfrastructure.  \nWhere decommissioning is reliant on, or affected by, work at other sites (for \nexample treatment, storage or disposal of radioactive waste) then the strategy \nshould address these interdependences. \nFleet considerations may also be appropriate if the Licensee operates multiple \nsite licenses. \nConsideration of factors external to the licensee should also be evident, such \nas confirmation that wastes anticipated to be generated meet the relevant meet \nfor the intended waste route, or that suitable transport packages have been \nidentified. \n\n5.43 \n\nInspectors should consider whether the licensee has examined an adequate range of \noptions for decommissioning and confirm that these form the basis of the licensees \ndecommissioning strategy. The optioneering process should be based on appropriate \nassessment criteria. The assessment criteria should be defined and developed by the \nlicensee, but inspectors may want to make a comparison with the list of relevant \nfactors in the SAPs under principle DC.3 (timing of decommissioning).  \n\n5.44 \n\nIn particular inspectors should also consider whether the following factors are included \nin the option selection criteria: \n\nHow options deliver longer-term risk reduction. \nThe dis-benefits of not pursuing any particular option. \nAvoiding the foreclosure of options for later decommissioning stages, \nparticularly where there are uncertainties associated with the possible success \nof options. \n\n5.45 \n\nInspectors should consider how the option selection process addresses the major \nassumptions and uncertainties relevant to the decommissioning task or project being \nconsidered. Sensitivity analysis and contingency planning should be considered for \nany areas of significant uncertainty. \n\n5.46  The licensee\u2019s strategy and plans need to be in evidence, but should be at a level of \n\ndetail commensurate to the current stage in the lifecycle. These should deliver the \ndesired outcome of risk-reduction. Hence, prioritisation of activities should be in line \nwith achievement of risk reduction. \n\n5.47  However, prioritisation should take account of other considerations where relevant and \n\njustified. Examples might include: \n\nEnabling tasks may be required to facilitate future risk reduction, e.g. in the \ninstallation of decommissioning infrastructure. \nIn some cases dismantling of lower risk systems/facilities may be required or \nbeneficial in creating the space and access necessary for other \ndecommissioning operations, or to provide training and experience. \nWhere age limiting features dictate the early removal of a lower risk system or \nfacility in preference to a higher risk one. \nValue and cost-benefit arguments, i.e. efficiency. \n\nNS-TAST-GD-026 Revision 5  \nRef: 2019/144943  \n\nPage 13 of 31 \n\n \n \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\uf06e \n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\fOffice for Nuclear Regulation  \n \n \n\n5.48  Licensees may have their own prioritisation process, but inspectors should look to see \n\nthat key prioritisation decisions have been appropriately justified, whichever process \nthe licensee has adopted. \n\n5.49  Decommissioning strategies may take account of the benefits of radioactive decay \n\n(e.g. cobalt in reactor steelwork) while taking due cognisance of any dis-benefits, such \nas ingrowth of longer-lived or higher dose-rate daughter radionuclides and potential for \ndeterioration of containment barriers. They should seek to avoid the creation of \nradioactive wastes in forms that may reduce the number of options for safe and \neffective long-term waste management.  \n\n5.50  The timescales over which decommissioning will take place should be defined in a \n\ndecommissioning programme . Decommissioning programmes should deliver the \ndesired outcome of risk-reduction and prioritisation of activities should be in line with \nachievement of this principle. The licensee should explain the timescales for these \nprogrammes / projects. \n\n5.51  When assessing such justifications inspectors should take into account the relevant \n\nfactors listed in the SAPs [1] under principle DC.3 which may be influencing the \nlicensees proposed strategy. This list of factors is applicable to all types of nuclear \nfacilities.  \n\n5.52  When justifying the timing of decommissioning it is good practice for the licensee to \n\nundertake appropriate stakeholder engagement. \n\n5.53  Decommissioning tasks typically lead to the generation of radioactive waste in solid, \n\nliquid or gaseous forms and may result in short-term increases in discharges of some \nradionuclides. In such circumstances, the licensee will need to demonstrate to the \nrelevant environmental regulator that the adopted strategy represents an optimal \napproach and reflects the application of Best Available Techniques (BAT), as required \nby the relevant environmental legislation. \n\n5.54  Decommissioning may proceed as a continuous activity, or as a series of sequential \n\nstages, the end result of each stage being a significant reduction in hazard. The order, \ntiming and extent of each stage will be influenced by the hazard posed by a particular \nfacility on a site. Licensees should adequately justify of the order and timescales over \nwhich it proposes to address each hazard.  \n\n5.55 \n\nIn general, Inspectors should expect the licensee to prioritise the removal and/or \nimmobilisation of the most active or mobile material to be carried out on the shortest \npracticable timescale, with further actions following with timescales appropriate to the \nremaining hazards they address. In some circumstances, actions may be required that \ntemporarily increase risk to enable hazard reduction to take place. In such \ncircumstances the licensee should justify its overall approach and ensure that risks are \nreduced ALARP across all stages. \n\n5.56 \n\nInspectors should recognise the risks associated with particular decommissioning \ntasks can be increased due to the presence of uncertainty or specific safety \nchallenges, e.g. accessibility or confined space working. \n\n5.57  Adequate arrangements should include the production and maintenance of strategies, \n\nprogrammes and plans for the decommissioning of all nuclear facilities for which the \nlicensee is responsible, including the future management and disposal of all the \nradioactive waste arising from the site. These should take into account government \npolicy and related national strategies, for example on decommissioning or radioactive \nwaste management and disposal.  \n\nNS-TAST-GD-026 Revision 5  \nRef: 2019/144943  \n\nPage 14 of 31 \n\n \n \n\n\fOffice for Nuclear Regulation  \n \n \n\n5.58  There are inherent uncertainties in decommissioning. Inspectors should look to see \n\nthat a licensee\u2019s arrangements, strategies and safety cases adequately take account \nof these, with appropriate mitigation and contingencies put in place. \n\n5.59 \n\nInspectors should give careful consideration to assessing arrangements, strategies, \nprogrammes and safety cases involving facilities where the risks are intolerable, close \nto becoming intolerable, or may soon become intolerable. In addition to the guidance \ngiven throughout this TAG, inspectors should particularly consider the following:   \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\nHow the Licensee\u2019s longer-term strategy and plans should deliver the desired \noutcome of large-scale hazard and risk reduction over an appropriate period of \ntime. \nHow short-term hazard and risks will be managed and longer-term hazard and \nrisk reduction achieved.   Regulatory monitoring of enabling milestones is \nrequired to provide evidence that projects are progressing as agreed, given that \nprojects may run over many years to reach the desired outcome. \nThe Licensee should have a clearly defined, robust, but not overly bureaucratic \nprocess for managing risk-reducing projects. This should focus on delivering \nsafe and timely remediation of high-risk hazards. \nThe principle of defence-in-depth with a suitable number of barriers should be \napplied. Inspectors should acknowledge that some levels of defence-in-depth \nwill not be available in certain circumstances, and that mitigation will have to be \nstrengthened where protection is missing or rudimentary. \nThe worst-case accident scenarios need to be identified to allow adequate \nprotection or mitigation and recovery measures to be developed. \nSimultaneous high-risk activities on the same facility or related facilities should \nbe avoided so far as is reasonably practicable, i.e. to prevent the occurrence of \none fault leading to the initiation and progression of another(s).  This should \ninclude consideration of any foreseeable beyond-design-basis fault \nprogression, as illustrated by the Fukushima incident.   \nClear mitigation/contingency measures need to be provided and developed to \nan appropriate level against fault sequences assigned a high probability of \noccurrence.  However, for some legacy facilities it needs to be recognised that \nemergency response/contingency measures will be an essential part of the \nsafety demonstration, given the absence of some of the levels of protection that \nwould be in place in a modern plant. These should not be the sole safeguard \nagainst identified fault scenarios, so far as is reasonably practicable. \nOperating and emergency procedures/instructions should recognise and \naddress key issues and identified fault sequences related to the implementation \nof a proposed modification to ensure measures are tailored to specific \ncircumstances. \n\nReview of Decommissioning Strategies \n\n5.60 \n\nIn 1995 the UK Government issued a policy statement [14] that introduced a \nresponsibility on ONR (the then Nuclear Installations Inspectorate of HSE) to review \nthe decommissioning strategy of each UK licensee at least every 5 years, which \nbecame known as the Quinquennial Review process (QQR). \n\n5.61 \n\nIn recognition of the creation of NDA, the UK Government revised its decommissioning \npolicy in 2004 [15] and therein supported continuance of the QQR process, except \nwhere \u201cequivalent arrangements\u201d are made, e.g. by the NDA. \n\n5.62  The Energy Act 2004 requires NDA to review its strategy at least every 5 years and to \n\nundertake statutory consultation with the public and regulators. ONR has therefore \nscrutinised each revision of NDA\u2019s strategy to date and interprets this to be an \n\u2018equivalent arrangement\u2019 to QQR for the licensed sites owned by NDA. As a \nconsequence, individual QQRs are no longer carried out at sites in the NDA estate. \n\nNS-TAST-GD-026 Revision 5  \nRef: 2019/144943  \n\nPage 15 of 31 \n\n \n \n\n\fOffice for Nuclear Regulation  \n \n \n\n5.63  The operators of sites owned by NDA are required through their contracts with NDA to \nproduce and maintain detailed plans to a prescribed format that covers the whole site \nlifecycle, including decommissioning. These plans are reviewed regularly and \nsummaries of the extant plans are made available on NDA\u2019s website. \n\n5.64  A range of other bodies now have interests in decommissioning strategies across \n\nportfolios of sites outside the NDA estate (e.g. the Nuclear Liabilities Fund in respect of \nEdF; the Nuclear Liabilities Funding Assurance Board in respect of new build, and; \nMoD in respect of its liabilities on the defence sites). Each of these bodies has \nbespoke expectations for licensees within its remit, some of which have a formal basis \nin law (e.g. the requirement of the Energy Act 2008 for an operator of a new nuclear \npower station to have a Funded Decommissioning Programme approved by the \nSecretary of State prior to construction). \n\n5.65 \n\nIn judging whether alternative approaches constitute an \u2018equivalent arrangement\u2019 to \nQQR, Inspectors should consider whether ONR has exercised sufficient oversight of \nthe decommissioning strategy in question to discharge the responsibility placed upon \nONR in Government policy without recourse to an additional formalised review. This \njudgement should take account of outcomes from other regulatory interventions, such \nas compliance inspections against the requirements of LC15 and LC35 or \nassessments for the purposes of EIADR. \n\nFacility decommissioning plan during design, construction and operational \nphases (WENRA SRLs D-19 \u2013 D-25) \n\n5.66 \n\nInitial strategies, programmes and plans should: \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\uf06e \n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\nDemonstrate that decommissioning can be feasibly and safely conducted using \nproven techniques or ones being developed. \nTake into account expected hazards and health & safety issues. \nIncorporate design for decommissioning features. \nAs far as practicable, the design should take account of features which may \nassist future decommissioning, including contamination and activation control, \nand aim to avoid features which will introduce unnecessary decommissioning \nhazards, e.g. construction techniques which would be difficult to reverse. \nThe key decommissioning measures and design features should be described \nand justified by the Licensee.  Such measures may need to be considered on \nbalance with construction and operational safety considerations. \nInclude waste management and environmental aspects of decommissioning, \nsuch as management of waste and radioactive effluents. \nInform the design process and vice versa. ALARP considerations should also \nbe apparent (appropriate to the design stage). \nBe used to inform the development of the construction arrangements and the \noperational and maintenance regimes where appropriate.  These should take \ndue account of the needs of decommissioning, including features to facilitate \ndecommissioning, providing for the early acquisition and maintenance of the \nrecords most important for decommissioning, and adoption of physical and \nprocedural methods to prevent the spread of contamination. Building \ninformation modelling can be a very useful tool for this purpose. \nBe used to provide a basis to assess the costs of the decommissioning work \nand the means of financing it. \n\n5.67 \n\nInspectors should expect to see initial plans developed at the planning phase of a new \nsite or facility. These should be commensurate with the scale of the facility, the type of \nthe inventory, and the stage in the facility\u2019s development i.e. proportionate and fit for \npurpose. \n\nNS-TAST-GD-026 Revision 5  \nRef: 2019/144943  \n\nPage 16 of 31 \n\n \n \n\n\fOffice for Nuclear Regulation  \n \n \n\n5.68  Some legacy facilities may not have had strategies in place from this early stage. In \n\nthese cases, inspectors should expect these to be produced based upon sufficient \ncharacterisation of the site / facility and the challenges which decommissioning will \nneed to address, i.e. an appropriate understanding of the start point condition. \n\n5.69  Generally, inspectors should expect an increase in the level of detail presented in the \ndecommissioning strategies and plans as the facility or site nears the end of its \noperational life and approaches the decommissioning phase. \n\n5.70  Examples of how this may apply in looking at safety cases are: \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\nInspectors should recognise that application of the engineering hierarchy and \nsubstantiation of safety measures to a level required for modern operating \nplants may not be practicable or desirable for aged facilities due to undergo \ndecommissioning.  Therefore, there is likely to be reliance on multi-legged \narguments and managerial safety measures.  These should be proportionate to \nthe hazards.   \nThe principle of defence\u2013in-depth with a suitable number of barriers should be \napplied (as appropriate to the risks involved). Inspectors should acknowledge \nthat some levels of defence-in-depth will not be available in certain \ncircumstances and that mitigation will have to be strengthened where \nprotection is missing or rudimentary. \n\n5.71  Optimisation is the term used by the IAEA in its Fundamental Safety Principles: Safety \n\nFundamentals [3] where principle 5 states, \u201cProtection must be optimised to provide \nthe highest level of safety that can reasonably be achieved.\u201d \n\n5.72 \n\n5.73 \n\nIn order to comply with UK legislation, licensees are required to apply the concept of \n\u201coptimisation\u201d in order to reduce risks to health and safety so far as is reasonably \npracticable (SFAIRP) in addition to utilising Best Available Techniques (BAT) in \nrespect of environmental protection. ONR\u2019s guidance on the demonstration ALARP \n(NS-TAST-GD-005) [3] and its supporting references contain ONR\u2019s general \nexpectations in respect of a licensee\u2019s demonstration that it has met the requirement to \nreduce risks SFAIRP, which is frequently expressed in terms of reducing risks ALARP. \n\nIn respect of decommissioning, there are some specific aspects of optimisation that \nONR might expect to be addressed as part of a licensee\u2019s arrangements to comply \nwith LC35. The precautionary principle should be applied to the uncertainties that often \nneed to be managed during decommissioning. NS-TAST-GD-005 [3] provides detailed \nguidance on this topic. Another important aspect relates to the potentially long \ntimescales involved, and hence the increased importance of economic, social and \nenvironmental factors such as sustainable development and long-term environmental \ndamage. \n\nFinal decommissioning plan (WENRA SRLs D-26 \u2013 D-28) \n\n5.74  Strategies, programmes, plans and safety cases should be well developed and in \nplace before decommissioning starts. Inspectors should check that there is no gap \nbetween the operational and decommissioning arrangements and that there is an \nappropriate interface between the two, where this is relevant. \n\n5.75 \n\nInspectors should consider whether the decommissioning strategy proposes \nappropriate end state conditions for the facility or site that are consistent with national \npolicies and regulatory expectations.   \n\n5.76  One possible end state is where all licensable activity has ceased, the licence is \n\nrevoked or handed back and the period of responsibility under NIA1965 has been \n\nNS-TAST-GD-026 Revision 5  \nRef: 2019/144943  \n\nPage 17 of 31 \n\n \n \n\n\fOffice for Nuclear Regulation  \n \n \n\nended. This is referred to as de-licensing and inspectors are referred to ONR\u2019s \nseparate guidance on this [20].  \n\n5.77  However this is not a mandatory requirement and other end states are possible in \n\nwhich some restriction on future use and continued legal responsibilities under nuclear \nlegislation continue.  \n\n5.78 \n\nIn some cases interim states may be identified. These should be treated as milestones \nwithin the overall decommissioning plan and are not end states as covered by this \nsection of the guidance. The overall strategy/programme should show how \ndecommissioning will progress safely beyond such interim states.   \n\n5.79  The precise format of the decommissioning programme is for the Licensee to propose \nand justify, but Inspectors should expect the following aspects to be adequately \nconsidered: \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\uf06e \n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\uf06e \n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\nA defined inventory of the plants and liabilities, e.g. radiological inventory, (or a \npredicted inventory for those plants not at the end of their operational life). \nThe rationale for selecting the chosen decommissioning option. \nThe rationale for the proposed timing of decommissioning.  \nDefined end state criteria (and the methodology for subsequently confirming \nthat these criteria have been achieved).  \nA description of the decommissioning activities (including the content of the \nindividual stages), if a staged approach is applied.  \nWhere appropriate decommissioning should be divided into stages, in which \ncase ONR may specify where consent is required to commence a stage or to \nproceed from one stage to the next.   \nA Post Operational Clean Out (POCO) strategy. \nArrangements for asset management during the decommissioning process.  \nIf the plans include a deferment of decommissioning with an associated care \nand maintenance period, the arrangements should include procedures and \nplans to maintain safety during the care and maintenance period. Such \narrangements must include plans to manage any risks arising to the health and \nsafety of workers, such as those arising from asbestos containing materials. \nAppropriate technical underpinning of the decommissioning methodology, \nincluding any key assumptions.   \nIdentification of any relevant Research and Development (R&D) requirements \nor opportunities, e.g. technology developments.  \nIdentification of the need for facilities to carry out decommissioning and waste \nmanagement, including potential use of supply chain capabilities for treatment. \nA safety case justification, including the identification of safety and radiation \nprotection measures/strategies.  The overarching strategy for safety \nmanagement systems should also be evident, and will identify existing facilities \nand equipment that will be used during decommissioning and any necessary \nchanges to the existing safety systems, or the need for replacement or new \nplant or equipment to carry out decommissioning operations. \nThe management arrangements to ensure safe delivery of the \ndecommissioning projects, including arrangements for the management of \nchange within the organisation during decommissioning. \n\nDecommissioning plan update during decommissioning operations (WENRA \nSRL D-29) \n\n5.80 \n\nInspectors should assess whether arrangements for decommissioning include \nappropriate review and change control procedures for the decommissioning \nprogrammes, plans, safety cases and procedures. Reviews should take place at least \nas frequently as the periodic safety review as required under LC15, but an increased \n\nNS-TAST-GD-026 Revision 5  \nRef: 2019/144943  \n\nPage 18 of 31 \n\n \n \n\n\fOffice for Nuclear Regulation  \n \n \n\nfrequency may be necessary to reflect the progressive change in plant status, hazards \nor decommissioning approach as decommissioning progresses. \n\n5.81  Changes which could warrant a review and subsequent modification of plans and \n\nprogrammes may include (but are not limited to): \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\uf06e \n\uf06e \n\uf06e \n\nSignificant changes to the facility (physical, ageing, inventory, etc), including \nchanges resulting from the decommissioning operations. \nImproved plant characterisation data, resulting from plant characterisation \ntasks. \nSignificant changes to the decommissioning processes or strategy adopted; \ne.g. those that \n\no  Significantly affect the safety of the overall decommissioning programme; \no  Significantly affect the time in which decommissioning will be completed \no  Significantly affect the way in which decommissioning will be carried out, e.g. \nthe use of new, untried or significantly different methods to those assessed \npreviously; \n\no  Significantly affect the way in which radioactive waste will be dealt with, e.g. \n\ndifferent disposal options or new methods of waste treatment; or \n\no  Change the proposed end state \n\nMajor deviations from the scheduled programme. \nMajor deviations in the assumed status of the facility, e.g. in light of new \ncharacterisation data.  In particular the identification of new hazards or \nsignificant changes to the assessed consequences of hazards.  \nRelevant operational feedback, or changes in relevant good practice. \nNew or revised legislative or regulatory requirements. \nSignificant technological developments or opportunities. \nAvailability of anticipated external resources such as transport flasks, storage \nfacilities or available disposal routes. \n\nCONDUCT OF DECOMMISSIONING   \n\nSafety classification (WENRA SRL D-30) \n\n5.82  As decommissioning progresses, there may be a change in the importance of \n\ndesignated SSCs to safety. It may therefore be appropriate to declassify or downgrade \nSSCs not required post-operations, or as decommissioning transitions between \nphases, provided this is justified in an update of the safety case. Conversely, some \nSSCs may become more important, or new SSCs may even potentially be required to \nsupport decommissioning operations. \n\n5.83 \n\nInspectors should consider the sufficiency and appropriateness of any remaining SSCs \nto the operations planned during subsequent phases of decommissioning. It is \ndesirable for the licensee to minimise its reliance on active safety systems to maintain \nadequate safety margins during any C&M phase(s).  \n\n5.84  Further guidance is contained within NS-TAST-GD-094 (Categorisation of safety \n\nfunctions and classification of structures and components) [3]. \n\nOn-site emergency preparedness (WENRA SRLs D-31 \u2013 D-34) \n\n5.85  The licensee\u2019s emergency planning arrangements should be updated to reflect the \n\nchanging hazard as the site transitions from operations through the various stages of \ndecommissioning, such that the arrangements remain appropriate to the current state \nof the plant. \n\n5.86  Amendments to the emergency plan associated with decommissioning typically result \nin a reduced scope of available on site resource, with increasing call for off-site \nresponders to support the emergency organisation.  \n\nNS-TAST-GD-026 Revision 5  \nRef: 2019/144943  \n\nPage 19 of 31 \n\n \n \n\n\fOffice for Nuclear Regulation  \n \n \n\n5.87  Guidance on licensee\u2019s arrangements for emergency preparedness are covered \nelsewhere under specific guidance, such as NS-INSP-GD-011 (LC11 Emergency \narrangements) [16] and the new Approved Code of Practice (ACoP) to the Radiation \n(Emergency Preparedness and Public Information) Regulations 2019 [17]. \n\nDecommissioning experience feedback (WENRA SRLs D-35 \u2013 D-37) \n\n5.88  The licensee\u2019s arrangements should include procedures to identify, screen, analyse, \n\nand document events, at the facility and from external sources, in a systematic way to \nimprove and ensure safe decommissioning. Inspectors should ensure that operational \nfeedback is appropriately considered within the decommissioning safety case. \n\n5.89  This feedback may come from events during decommissioning, or from other facilities \n\noperated by the licensee. Inspectors should look to see that feedback from events prior \nto decommissioning is included, for example findings of differences between \u201cas built\u201d \nplant and the design drawings, past plant modifications, incidents, spillages etc. \nLearning from post-project reviews should also be considered and incorporated as \nappropriate. Additional feedback can be sourced from other operators and wider \nindustry organisations, both national and international.  \n\n5.90  The licensee\u2019s duties under LC7 are unchanged during the decommissioning phase of \n\nthe lifecycle, to notify record and investigate incidents on the site. Where learning \npoints are identified following investigation of an event with significance for safety, \nappropriate corrective actions should be implemented to prevent reoccurrence of \nsimilar events or address other developments adverse to safety. \n\nWaste management (WENRA SRLs D-38 \u2013 D-40) \n\n5.91  Decommissioning generally results in a broader range of wastes than the preceding \n\nphases of the lifecycle, in terms of physical characteristics, radiological contents, \nchemo-toxic properties and the volumes arising. The licensee should therefore \nconsider the need to strengthen its waste management infrastructure and processes \nprior to undertaking decommissioning, to ensure all the anticipated wastes will be \nmanaged in accordance with regulatory expectations such as LC32 and the Joint \nGuidance on management of Higher Activity Wastes. \n\n5.92  The licensee should adopt a precautionary approach to any inherent uncertainties in \n\nrespect of its decommissioning wastes and put in place contingency arrangements \nagainst potential cliff-edge effects (e.g. a lack of characterisation data may preclude an \naccurate assessment of a waste stream\u2019s categorisation as LLW or ILW). \n\n5.93  The licensee\u2019s decommissioning strategy and plan should identify the types of waste \nthat are expected to be generated and demonstrate that the chosen decontamination \nand dismantling techniques meet regulatory expectations with respect to the waste \nmanagement hierarchy [11]. \n\n5.94  The hierarchy encourages adoption of options for managing waste in the order of: \n\n- \n- \n- \n- \n- \n\nPrevent waste from arising in the first place \nMinimise the quantity of waste produced \nReuse of those wastes that cannot be prevented \nRecycling of waste into a form that allows it to be reclaimed \nDisposal should only occur when waste cannot be prevented, reused or \nrecycled and must be implemented in a manner that is compliant with the \nenvironmental legislation \n\n5.95  An essential first step in implementation of the hierarchy is for a licensee to \n\nappropriately characterise and then segregate its wastes, to enable optimised waste \nmanagement through to the point of disposal. The licensee\u2019s system of \n\nNS-TAST-GD-026 Revision 5  \nRef: 2019/144943  \n\nPage 20 of 31 \n\n \n \n\n\fOffice for Nuclear Regulation  \n \n \n\ncharacterisation and segregation should enable the wastes arising to be disposed of at \nthe lowest practicable categorisation. This should include exemption and clearance of \nthose decommissioning wastes that have potential to be disposed of as non-\nradioactive material. Further guidance may be found in IAEA Safety Guide RS-G-1.7 \n[4]. \n\n5.96  LC32 imposes the duty upon licensees to minimise the total quantity, and rate of \n\nproduction of radioactive waste, so far as is reasonably practicable [3], which is \nparticularly pertinent to decommissioning given the potential to generate large \nquantities of waste.  \n\n5.97  The licensee\u2019s radioactive waste management arrangements should therefore be \nupdated to reflect the changing nature of the radioactive waste being generated, \nincluding consideration of appropriate characterisation and segregation to enable \noptimised management and minimise the volumes of radioactive waste requiring \ndisposal, so far as is reasonably practicable. This may be captured in an Integrated \nWaste Strategy and/or the Waste Management Plan that is formally required by the \nenvironmental regulators. \n\n5.98  The SAPs state that radiological hazards should be reduced systematically and \n\nprogressively, with radioactive waste generated processed into a passive safe state, \nas soon as is reasonably practicable (RW.6), and stored in accordance with good \nengineering practice (RW.5) [1].  \n\n5.99 \n\nInformation that might be needed for the current and future safe management of \nradioactive waste should be recorded and preserved (RW.7). This is particularly \nimportant for any radioactive wastes generated during decommissioning which do not \nyet have an available waste route and will therefore be stored for an extended period \nprior to disposal. The records should capture necessary information to enable the \ncontinued safe management of that waste whilst in storage, and also support the future \ndisposability case, as defined in the waste management and decommissioning plans. \n\n5.100  NS-TAST-GD-024 [3] and the joint regulatory guidance The Management of Higher \n\nActivity Radioactive Waste on Nuclear Licensed Sites [12] provide further general \nguidance on management of radioactive waste management. \n\nOn-site and off-site monitoring (WENRA SRL D-41) \n\n5.101  Licensees normally implement an on- and off-site monitoring programme to \n\ndemonstrate effective management of its operations and protection the public. This \nmonitoring should include on plant monitoring for the purposes of demonstrating \ncompliance with LC34 (Leakage and escape of radioactive material and radioactive \nwaste), as well as environmental monitoring. \n\n5.102  As a facility transitions into decommissioning, the type of operations conducted on the \nsite and the hazards they pose will naturally differ to those during operations. As such \nthe licensee should review and modify its monitoring programme to ensure it remains \nappropriate and takes due account of the changes to the facility, any specific hazards \narising, and the effluents associated with each phase of decommissioning. \n\n5.103  One key aspect of environmental monitoring relates to land quality management \n\n(LQM). Whilst this is an area of regulation which requires joint working with colleagues \nat the relevant environmental regulator, it should be recognised by the Inspector that \nONR has lead responsibility for regulation of radioactively contaminated land on \nnuclear licensed sites.  \n\n5.104  The joint regulatory guidance Regulatory Expectations for Successful Land Quality \nManagement at Nuclear Licensed Sites [18] advocates licensees implement LQM \n\nNS-TAST-GD-026 Revision 5  \nRef: 2019/144943  \n\nPage 21 of 31 \n\n \n \n\n\fOffice for Nuclear Regulation  \n \n \n\nthroughout the lifetime of the facility. However, as a site moves into decommissioning \nand implements plans to reach its desired end state, LQM will take on greater \nimportance. Further guidance is provided in NS-TAST-GD-083 (Land Quality \nManagement) [3]. \n\nMaintenance, Testing and Inspection (WENRA SRLs D-42 \u2013 D-44) \n\n5.105  Structures, systems and components should be capable of delivering their required \nsafety function until the associated hazards have been removed or mitigated. There \nshould therefore be adequate consideration of continued maintenance, testing and \ninspection of SSCs during decommissioning until the SSC is no longer required, as \njustified within the safety case. \n\n5.106  Maintenance schedules should take into account operational limits and conditions as \nrequired in the decommissioning safety case, and re-evaluated in light of operational \nexperience and continuous changes to the plant throughout decommissioning.  \n\n5.107  Adequate asset management is required to ensure the facility remains safe and does \n\nnot degrade to an unacceptable state. Major issues can arise if decommissioning \nprogrammes are delayed and as such the maintenance, testing and inspection of \nSSCs and important assets, which may not necessarily be claimed within the safety \ncase, must therefore address ageing and consider the future decommissioning plan \ntimescales, as appropriate. Inspectors should ensure appropriate consideration of \nasset management plans should decommissioning programmes be delayed to ensure \nthis does not lead to unacceptable degradation of plant or buildings. \n\n5.108  Inspectors should consider whether the licensee\u2019s plans adequately address the \n\nfollowing: \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\nAppropriate baseline characterisation of the assets and the hazards that they \nprotect against. \nProgrammes for the identification, examination, maintenance, testing, \nsurveillance and inspection of SSCs important to safety, which take into \naccount operational limits and conditions. \nConsideration of ageing, deterioration mechanisms, and obsolescence of \nSSCs, and the inspection and monitoring of such factors, particularly where \ndecommissioning is expected to take place over long timescales. \nPeriodic review (e.g. inspections or tests) of SSCs to determine whether they \nare still acceptable. \nSystems to ensure the prompt repair of SSCs, prioritised to take account of the \nrelative importance to safety of the defective SSC. \nSystems to ensure the appropriate remedial action following any abnormal \nevent which is significant for the safety of decommissioning activities, including \ninspection, testing, maintenance and repair of SSCs, as appropriate. \nArrangements to review, as necessary, the examination and maintenance and \ntesting program, to take account of the rapid changes to the facility during \ndecommissioning. \nSimilar arrangements to those listed above for any key building structures, \nservices or other systems which are not designated as SSCs but do perform \nimportant functions. \nIn taking account of the above factors, plans should adequately address any \nrisks to workers arising from access to buildings, facilities, and structures. \n\n5.109  Further general guidance on expectations relating to maintenance is contained in NS-\nTAST-GD-009 (Examination, Inspection, Maintenance and Testing of Items Important \nto Safety) and NS-TAST-GD-098 (Asset Management) [3]. \n\nNS-TAST-GD-026 Revision 5  \nRef: 2019/144943  \n\nPage 22 of 31 \n\n \n \n\n\fOffice for Nuclear Regulation  \n \n \n\nControl of decommissioning activities (WENRA SRLs D-45 \u2013 D-47) \n\n5.110  Licensees are required to control activities it undertakes during decommissioning that \nmay impact upon safety through use of suitable processes and procedures approved \nby the licensee as part of its management system. Given the dynamic state of a facility \nduring decommissioning, the licensee should review and update its processes and \nprocedures used during operations, as necessary, to ensure they remain adequate \nand applicable to decommissioning activities. \n\n5.111  The arrangements should ensure that no decommissioning activity is undertaken \n\nwithout a prior assessment of its impact on safety, taking into account the postulated \ninitiating events with internal causes included in the safety case for decommissioning. \nSuch arrangements should give due consideration to different decommissioning \nactivities executed in parallel, which might adversely affect safety of each other. \n\n5.112  Modifications, to the plant and of planned decommissioning activities, should be \ncontrolled by the licensee, as per its LC22 arrangements, according to the safety \nsignificance through application of an adequate categorisation scheme; ensuring \nappropriate focus is retained on those activities which may have a significant impact \nupon safety. The LC22 arrangements should also take into account the cumulative \neffects of changes to procedures, modifications to the facility and the decommissioning \norganisation, technical developments, decommissioning experience accumulated and \nageing of safety systems and components, to ensure there is no overall degradation in \nsafety standards. \n\n5.113  As facilities are decommissioned and redundant safety systems removed, there may \nbe increased reliance on administrative controls over engineered controls. Where this \nis the case, the inspector should consider whether the licensee has adequately \nconsidered human factors when determining the appropriate controls. The inspector \nmay also deem it necessary to seek specific assessment by a Human Factors \nspecialist, depending upon the significance of any change. Further guidance is \navailable in NS-TAST-GD-058 (Human Factors Integration) and NS-TAST-GD-063 \n(Human Reliability Analysis) [3].  \n\n5.114  Additional Human Factors specialist support may be relevant where the licensee \n\nintends to deploy new equipment during decommissioning, to ensure its design \nappropriately considers the human-machine interface. Further guidance is available in \nNS-TAST-GD-059 (Human Machine Interface) [3]. \n\nPeriod of Deferment (WENRA SRLs D-48 \u2013 D-49) \n\n5.115  In the UK, care and maintenance (C&M) refers to a specific period of planned \n\nquiescence on the site or in the facility between decommissioning phases, usually after \nPOCO or de-planting with deferred dismantling and final site clearance. \n\n5.116  During the C&M period the facility should be maintained in a passively safe \n\nconfiguration, so far as it is reasonably practicable, minimising the need for active \nsafety systems, monitoring, and human intervention. This approach may necessitate \nremoval or downgrading of existing SSCs associated with operations, where \nappropriate, if justified by an update of the safety case. \n\n5.117  If the licensee proposes a prolonged deferral strategy then the C&M requirements \nshould be developed, prior to the deferral commencing. These should be justified \nwithin a C&M programme that ensures continued safety of the facility, and this \nprogramme should ensure the ability to decommission the facility safely in the future. \n\n5.118  When assessing the adequacy of the C&M arrangements inspectors should consider \n\nwhether the licensee has adequately: \n\nNS-TAST-GD-026 Revision 5  \nRef: 2019/144943  \n\nPage 23 of 31 \n\n \n \n\n\fOffice for Nuclear Regulation  \n \n \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\nminimised, so as far as reasonably practicable, the hazards presented by the \nradiological inventory prior to entering the C&M phase; \naddressed ageing, deterioration and obsolescence for safety systems that will \nbe required to remain operational, including potential for upgrade or \nreplacement and that this is included within the plan; and \nspecified the maintenance and examination regime. \n\n5.119  The licensee should record clear decisions regarding whether a period of C&M is \n\nappropriate, taking account of the status of the facility, the decommissioning strategy, \ntimescales, etc. Inspectors should expect a robust safety case that takes account of \nlong-term safety as opposed to just renewing the short-term safety case underpinning \nsuch decisions.  \n\n5.120  The Licensee should demonstrate that they can ensure long-term safety by ensuring \n\nand monitoring a safe plant configuration and maintaining an appropriate organisation, \nsupporting infrastructure and corporate memory. The safety case should define a limit \nto the period of proposed deferment. \n\n5.121  The safety case should justify and demonstrate safety for the proposed period of \ndeferral. The Inspector may choose to assess whether the following is adequately \nconsidered in the safety case: \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\uf06e \n\nany cliff-edge effects, e.g. those associated with infrastructure availability, \ndegradation of the structures or obsolescence of systems; \nthe effects of deferral should not impact upon the ability to conduct future \ndecommissioning in a safe way where risks are ALARP; \nthe whole lifecycle radiation doses associated with C&M and decommissioning \nshould be ALARP; \ninterdependences of different facilities on a site; and \nknowledge management and retention of necessary skills and expertise.  \n\n5.122  Notwithstanding a justified period of deferral, licensees should adopt decommissioning \n\nprogrammes which are sufficiently flexible to facilitate acceleration of the programme, \nshould this be necessary for safety reasons. \n\nSAFETY VERIFICATION   \n\nContents, review and update of the safety case for decommissioning (WENRA \nSRLs D-50 \u2013 D-56) \n\n5.123  Inspectors should refer to NS-TAST-GD-051 (The purpose, scope and content of \n\nnuclear safety cases) [3] for general guidance on safety cases. The following provides \nadditional guidance to inspectors regarding the assessment of safety cases for the \ndecommissioning of facilities on nuclear licensed sites. \n\n5.124  A decommissioning safety case should demonstrate how the licensee will manage \n\nshort-term risks and achieve longer-term risk reduction over the full term of the \ndecommissioning programme. The safety case should include assessment of any \nplanned new installations, facilities or systems to necessary to support the \ndecommissioning programme, and include the final decommissioning of such \ninfrastructure itself. \n\n5.125  Specific radiological hazards that are of particular importance in the case of \n\ndecommissioning include, for example, cutting of activated and contaminated material, \nmodification of safety barriers, entry into areas of the plant that were previously \ninaccessible, decontamination of large items, dispersion of contamination during \ndemolition. This is not an exhaustive nor exclusive list, and licensees should \n\nNS-TAST-GD-026 Revision 5  \nRef: 2019/144943  \n\nPage 24 of 31 \n\n \n \n\n\fOffice for Nuclear Regulation  \n \n \n\ndemonstrate that its hazard identification process has adequately considered all \nrelevant hazards and fault conditions. \n\n5.126  The safety case should incorporate learning from experience of operating the facility, \nas well as learning from relevant decommissioning projects elsewhere, whether in the \nUK or internationally. \n\n5.127  During decommissioning, the risks associated with conventional health and safety \n\nhazards arising from de-planting and demolition activities (eg asbestos, confined \nspaces), will inevitably increase. As such, the safety case should adequately consider \nthe appropriate management of conventional health and safety risks where these have \nthe potential to impact upon nuclear safety. \n\n5.128  The safety case should be appropriately underpinned by knowledge of the risk and \nbalanced assessment of associated uncertainties, particularly in the case of legacy \nfacilities. This should be supported by the examination of records and conducting of \nsurveys and measurements to verify the inventory and locations of radioactive, fissile \nor other hazardous materials in the facility, and the surrounding potentially affected \nareas. \n\n5.129  Where the licensee identifies additional research is required to underpin its \n\ndecommissioning proposals, or to mitigate uncertainties, this should be recognised in \nthe safety case, and appropriate plans put in place to deliver the necessary work. \n\n5.130  Inspectors should consider the licensee\u2019s arrangements to maintain the safety case(s) \n\nwhen significant changes occur, according to the safety relevance of such changes \nand licensee\u2019s categorisation. These might include modifications to the facility, plan or \ndecommissioning practice at major steps in the decommissioning project, or new \nrelevant regulatory requirements.   \n\n5.131  Licensees should periodically review the safety case to confirm the decommissioning \nactivities and states are, and will continue to be in accordance with regulatory \nexpectations and legal requirements. Such reviews should also identify and evaluate \nthe safety significance of any deviations from applicable current safety standards and \nrelevant good practice, and ensure an adequate plan to address such deviations are \nimplemented.  \n\n5.132  The review should also take into account the cumulative effects of, for example, \n\nchanges to procedures, modifications to the facility or the decommissioning \norganisation, and ageing of safety systems and components. Additionally, the review \nshould consider technical developments and decommissioning experience \naccumulated to update the safety case accordingly. \n\n5.133  In determining the frequency of reviews, the licensee should consider aligning periodic \nreviews with any major changes in the facility or hazard(s) which may arise well before \nan otherwise planned periodic review, notwithstanding the general expectation that the \ninterval between periodic safety reviews (PSR) should not exceed 10 years. General \nguidance on PSRs is provided in NS-TAST-GD-050 (Periodic safety reviews) [3]. \n\nDecommissioning reporting and Licence termination conditions (WENRA SRLs \nD-57 \u2013 D-62) \n\n5.134  The decommissioning plan and associated programme(s) should include sufficient \n\nshort and long term milestones and deliverables to enable progress to be monitored. \nThese milestones will usually coincide with major step changes hazard profile of the \nsite, as associated with the transition from one stage of decommissioning to the next. \nThe licensee should develop suitable metrics to facilitate monitoring and reporting \nagainst the identified decommissioning milestones. \n\nNS-TAST-GD-026 Revision 5  \nRef: 2019/144943  \n\nPage 25 of 31 \n\n \n \n\n\fOffice for Nuclear Regulation  \n \n \n\n5.135  ONR may specify that the licensee may not move from one stage to the next without \nthe consent of ONR (LC35). Examples may include transition into a period of care & \nmaintenance, or commencement of final dismantling and demolition. \n\n5.136  The licensee should identify those records to be available after the completion of \n\ndecommissioning, how they will be kept and the necessary retention period. This can \nbe done either by the licensee or under quality controlled arrangements for the \ninformation to be kept by a third party, eg at the Nucleus Archive in Caithness. \n\n5.137  ONR\u2019s publication Licensing Nuclear Installations [19] explains the circumstances in \nwhich a nuclear site licence may be revoked by ONR or surrendered by the licensee. \nHowever a licensee\u2019s \u201cperiod of responsibility\u201d can only end when: \n\n\uf06e \n\uf06e \n\uf06e \n\na new licence has been granted for the site \nthe site is used by the Crown and does not require a licence, or \nONR has given written notice that in its opinion there has ceased to be any \ndanger from ionising radiations from anything on the site. \n\n5.138  Before issuing such a notice, ONR will assess whether the site has been \n\ndecommissioned to the point where the remaining risks satisfy the \u201cno danger\u201d criterion \nderived from sections 3(12)(b) and 5(15)(a) of NIA65. Consideration of a licensee\u2019s \ncase for demonstrating \u201cno danger\u201d should be carried out against ONR\u2019s dedicated \nguidance [20]. Until such time as the licensee can provide an adequate demonstration \nof compliance with the \u201cno danger\u201d criterion, it will retain responsibility for safety on the \nsite. \n\n5.139  As decommissioning progresses towards its final stages and the nuclear hazard is \nprogressively reduced, the hazard profile will tend to change towards conventional \nsafety and environmental protections issues. The continued application of the nuclear \nlicensing regime to these final stages of decommissioning was subject to a \ngovernment consultation on alternative approaches [21].  \n\n5.140  The UK Government is seeking to amend the regulatory framework that applies to the \nfinal stages of nuclear site decommissioning to by adopting the 2014 Paris Convention \nDecommissioning Exclusion [22]. Under this Exclusion, the nuclear liability regime will \ncease to apply for nuclear sites that meet the qualifying criteria; third party damage or \ninjury will then be covered by ordinary law third party liability.  \n\n5.141  ONR will continue to provide effective and proportionate regulation of the delicensing \n\nof nuclear sites through amendment of the delicensing criteria, should the Exclusion be \nadopted into UK legislation.  \n\n \n\n \n\nNS-TAST-GD-026 Revision 5  \nRef: 2019/144943  \n\nPage 26 of 31 \n\n \n \n\n\fOffice for Nuclear Regulation  \n \n \n\nREFERENCES\n\n6. \n\n \n\n1  \n\n2  \n\n3  \n\nSafety Assessment Principles for Nuclear Facilities, 2014 Edition Revision 0, \nNovember 2014.

In such cases, ONR\u2019s advice is based on an assessment of whether the \ndecommissioning strategy and plan on which the financial provisions are based aligns \nwith UK regulatory expectations. \n\nSites owned by the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA) are subject to statutory \nfinancial arrangements made in accordance with the Energy Act 2004, which assure \nthe provision of funds by the UK government. In addition to setting out the purposes, \nconstitution, staffing and proceedings of the NDA, the Energy Act 2004 identified ONR \nas a statutory consultee on NDA\u2019s Strategy. \n\nThe UK Government established the Nuclear Liabilities Fund (NLF) in 1996 with the \nkey purpose of funding the costs of decommissioning the eight nuclear power stations \n(7 AGR and 1 PWR) currently operated in the UK by EdF Energy (EdF). The UK \nGovernment also agreed to fund decommissioning of the eight power stations to the \nextent that the liability might exceed the assets of the NLF. In order to draw down on \nthe NLF, EdF must apply to NDA with a demonstration that the intended spend is \nagainst a qualifying liability. EdF is also required to submit to NDA a baseline \ndecommissioning plan (BDP), on which NDA seeks ONR\u2019s views. \n\nThe UK Government further legislated, in the Energy Act 2008, to ensure operators of \nany proposed new nuclear power stations built in the UK will have secure finance in \nplace to meet the full costs of future decommissioning. Under the Act, any such \noperator is required to have a Funded Decommissioning Programme (FDP) approved \nby the Secretary of State in place before construction of its power station begins, and \nto comply with the FDP thereafter. To ensure the operator makes prudent financial \nprovisions, the FDP is expected to: \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\nIdentify all the steps necessary to decommission the power station and manage \nand dispose of all associated wastes, including spent nuclear fuel \nGive due recognition to the government\u2019s \u2018Base Case\u2019 of key strategic \nassumptions  \n\nFinancial aspects of FDPs are scrutinised by the dedicated Nuclear Liabilities Funding \nAssurance Board (NLFAB) and ONR is recognised as a statutory consultee. Therefore \nONR would expect to provide advice to the Government on the technical content of an \nFDP in respect of its alignment with UK regulatory expectations. \n\nThe government published detailed guidance on the principles that the Secretary of \nState will expect to see satisfied in a duty holders\u2019 FDP prior to granting an approval: \nhttps://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachme\nnt_data/file/70214/guidance-funded-decommissioning-programme-consult.pdf \n\nNS-TAST-GD-026 Revision 5  \nRef: 2019/144943  \n\nPage 31 of 31 \n\n \n \n\n\f", "Design Safety Assurance ns-tast-gd-057.pdf\n Title of document \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nONR Guide \n\nDesign Safety Assurance \n\nDocument Type: \n\nNuclear Safety Technical Assessment Guide \n\nUnique Document ID and \nRevision No: \n\nNS-TAST-GD-057 Revision 5 \n\nDate Issued: \n\nNovember 2017 \n\nReview Date: \n\nNovember 2020 \n\nApproved by: \n\nGavin Smith \n\nMechanical Engineering Professional \nLead \n\nRecord Reference: \n\nTRIM Folder 1.1.3.776.

The \nprinciples presented in the SAPs are supported by a suite of guides to further assist \nONR\u2019s inspectors in their technical assessment work in support of making regulatory \njudgements and decisions.  This technical assessment guide is one of these guides. \n\n2. \n\nPURPOSE AND SCOPE \n\nThis Technical Assessment Guide (TAG) discusses ONR\u2019s approach to the \nassessment of design arrangements and processes for nuclear facilities, and how \nsafety is integrated into the design production process.  In particular, the design \narrangements should demonstrate how integration with procurement, site \nconstruction/installation and final commissioning is achieved, leading into operations \nand associated maintenance and inspection, as well as the safety case development \nprocess.  This TAG does not specifically address a single Licence Condition or group \nof Safety Assessment Principles, but concerns an area of activity which is of regulatory \ninterest. \n\nIt should be noted that the Nuclear Installations Act 1965 (as amended) makes specific \nreference to design as an activity which may be subject to licence conditions. \n\nLicence Condition 14 requires that the licensee \u201cshall make and implement adequate \narrangements for the production and assessment of safety cases consisting of \ndocumentation to justify safety during the design, construction, manufacture, \ncommissioning, operation and decommissioning phases of the installation.\u201d \n\nLicence Condition 19 requires that \u201cWhere the licensee proposes to construct or install \nany new plant which may affect safety the licensee shall make and implement \nadequate arrangements to control the construction or installation.\u201d \n\nLicence Condition 20 requires that \u201cThe licensee shall ensure that no modification to \nthe design which may affect safety is made to any plant during the period of \nconstruction except in accordance with adequate arrangements made and \nimplemented by the licensee for that purpose.\u201d \n\nLicence Condition 21 requires that \u201cThe licensee shall make and implement adequate \narrangements for the commissioning of any plant or process which may affect safety.\u201d \n\nLicence Condition 22 requires that \u201cThe licensee shall make and implement adequate \narrangements to control any modification or experiment carried out on any part of the \nexisting plant or processes which may affect safety.\u201d \n\nThis TAG contains general guidance to advise and inform ONR Inspectors in the \nexercise of their professional regulatory judgement.  This document is not intended to \nprovide detailed guidance on the design process for nuclear facilities, but is produced \nto highlight certain key areas for consideration as part of an assessment process. \n\nIt is therefore essential that comprehensive reference is made to the ONRs Safety \nAssessment Principles (SAPs) for Nuclear Facilities and other TAGs when assessing \nsuch design arrangements and processes.  References to the ONR SAPs and the \nWENRA Reactor Safety Reference Levels are included in the text of this document. \n\n1.1 \n\n2.1 \n\n2.2 \n\n2.3 \n\n2.4 \n\n2.5 \n\n2.6 \n\n2.7 \n\n2.8 \n\n2.9 \n\n2.10  Comments on this guide, and suggestions for future revisions, should be recorded on \n\nthe appropriate registry file.  \n\nReport  NS-TAST-GD-057 \nTRIM Ref: 2017/456576 \n\nPage 2 of 16 \n\n \n \n \n\n\fOffice for Nuclear Regulation  \n \n \n\n \n3. \n\n \n3.1 \n\n \n\n \n4. \n \n4.1 \n\n \n\n \n4.2 \n\nRELATIONSHIP TO LICENCE CONDITIONS \n\nThe following licence conditions have relevance in terms of design safety assurance: \n\n\uf09f  LC6 Documents, Records, Authorities and Certificates  \n\uf09f  LC12 Duly Authorised and other Suitably Qualified and Experienced Persons  \n\uf09f  LC14 Safety Documentation  \n\uf09f  LC15 Periodic Review  \n\uf09f  LC17 Quality Assurance  \n\uf09f  LC19 Construction or Installation of New Plant  \n\uf09f  LC20 Modification to Design of Plant Under Construction  \n\uf09f  LC21 Commissioning  \n\uf09f  LC22 Modification or Experiment on Existing Plant  \n\uf09f  LC23 Operating Rules  \n\uf09f  LC24 Operating Instructions  \n\uf09f  LC25 Operational Records  \n\uf09f  LC27 Safety Mechanisms, Devices and Circuits  \n\uf09f  LC28 Examination, Inspection, Maintenance and Testing  \n\uf09f  LC29 Duty to carry out Tests, Inspections and Examinations  \n\uf09f  LC34 Leakage and Escape of Radioactive Material and Radioactive Waste  \n\uf09f  LC35 Decommissioning  \n\uf09f  LC36 Control of Organisational Change  \n\nLEGISLATION AND REGULATORY INTEREST \n\nThe general duties under the Health and Safety at Work etc Act 1974 (HSWA) impose \nstatutory requirements as follows: \n\n2 (1)  It shall be the duty of every employer to ensure, so far as is reasonably \npracticable, the health, safety and welfare at work of all his employees. \n \n3 (1)  It shall be the duty of every employer to conduct his undertaking in such a way \nas to ensure, so far as is reasonably practicable, that persons not in his employment \nwho may be affected thereby are not thereby exposed to risks to their health or safety. \n \n6 (1)  It shall be the duty of any person who designs, manufactures, imports or supplies \nany article for use at work or any article of fairground equipment \u2013 \n \n(a)  to ensure, so far as is reasonably practicable, that the article is so designed and \nconstructed that it will be safe and without risks to health at all times when it is being \nset, used, cleaned or maintained by a person at work; \n \nIn addition, the Construction (Design and Management) Regulations 2015 place duties \non designers to take due recognition of health and safety in the design process.  The \nIonising Radiations Regulations 2017 also make specific reference to engineering \ncontrols and design features as the primary means of restricting exposure to ionising \nradiation.  Other regulations under the HSWA also impose duties on designers for \nspecified engineering features. Environmental Legislation, Security Legislation and \nInternational Treaties also impose legal duties on designers. \n\nIt should be recognised that design organisations may not be licensees themselves, \nbut should be under the control of the appropriate licensee; therefore acting as \nResponsible Designers to the licensee Design Authority, who also acts as an \nIntelligent Customer (see NS-TAST-GD-079 Licensee Design Authority Capability).  \n\nReport  NS-TAST-GD-057 \nTRIM Ref: 2017/456576 \n\nPage 3 of 16 \n\n \n \n \n\n\fOffice for Nuclear Regulation  \n \n \n\nNevertheless, the statutory legislation noted above, plus the licence conditions \nthemselves, provide the ONR with the necessary vires to regulate design activity, \nthrough coordination with the licensee. \n\nThis regulatory interest equally applies to the early stages of the design process, at the \noptioneering stages.  However, a clear balance needs to be struck between the \nbenefits of leverage which can be achieved by early guidance/intervention, and the \npotential negative, disruptive effects which can occur due to detailed questioning of \nearly concepts.  Furthermore, caution is necessary to ensure that an impression that a \ndesign has been approved is not given. \n\nIn particular, the ONR should focus on standards and principles, the visibility of \noptioneering to demonstrate ALARP plus the adequacy of the design process and \nassociated arrangements.  \n\nBMS GUIDANCE \n\nThe assessor needs to be aware of ONR\u2019s expectations more generally for Licensees\u2019 \nsafety cases and how they are produced, which are set out elsewhere within other \nBMS Guidance documentation. \n\nA number of other Technical Assessment Guides will be relevant to the subject of \nDesign Safety Assurance and the assessor should review the latest available \ninformation on the BMS. \n\nIn particular, NS-TAST-GD-079 addresses ONR\u2019s expectations for existing and \nprospective licensees\u2019 Design Authority capability. It considers the licensee\u2019s approach \nto: \n\n\uf09f  Identification and implementation of organisational arrangements and core \ncompetencies to understand and manage the design of its plant and the safety \nfunctions that need to be provided;  \n \n\uf09f  The use of contractors as \u2018Responsible Designers\u2019 to provide authoritative advice to \nthe Design Authority; \n \n\uf09f  The retention of design knowledge in a form that is practically and easily available to \nthe licensee over the full lifetime of the plant until the plant is decommissioned. \n\nIn particular, NS-TAST-GD-077 informs regulatory assessment of supply chain \narrangements which are particularly important to the supply of items or services \nsignificant to nuclear safety designated for use in the UK. It also provides guidance for \nregulatory inspection during the manufacturing stages. \n\nADVICE TO ASSESSORS \n\nIntroduction \n\n4.3 \n\n4.4 \n\n5. \n \n5.1 \n\n \n5.2 \n\n \n\n \n5.3 \n\n \n6. \n \n\n6.1 \n\nThis guide is concerned with the assessment of arrangements for the production of \ndesign for structures, systems and components for nuclear facilities.  These \narrangements should demonstrate that safety considerations are integral to the design \nprocess, and that the formal safety justification as evidenced by the relevant safety \ncase, is fully coordinated with the design activity and should evolve in parallel.  \n\n6.2 \n\nThe purpose of ONR assessment of design safety assurance is to establish whether \nthe design arrangements, including interfaces with procurement and \nconstruction/installation, leading into the operations and associated maintenance and \n\nReport  NS-TAST-GD-057 \nTRIM Ref: 2017/456576 \n\nPage 4 of 16 \n\n \n \n \n\n\fOffice for Nuclear Regulation  \n \n \n\n6.3 \n\n6.4 \n\n6.5 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\ninspection, are adequate to fulfil the required safety functions, and to establish that the \nhazards created by such arrangements are both tolerable and ALARP, in compliance \nwith legal requirements. \n\nEngineering background \n\nAll structures, systems and components are specified and designed to provide a \nrequired engineering functionality.  This functionality will have an influence on safety \nand so requires an appropriate safety categorisation / classification to be assigned.  \nThis categorisation / classification (or grading) will affect the design methods and \nstandards, material selection, procurement process, fabrication and installation \ninspections as well as maintenance requirements and in service inspections. \n\nIn any engineering process, the resource available (whether it be in time or budget) \nrelating to required activities such as design is always limited.  It is therefore \nappropriate that such resource is targeted at areas which have the greatest potential \nfor danger.  This is the basis for all engineering safety categorisation / classification \nsystems. \n\nDesign requirements and regulation  \n\nDesign requirements arise generally for the following reasons: \n\n\uf09f  The licensee wishes to design, construct, install and commission a facility on a new \nsite, or within an existing site.  Licence conditions 19, 20 and 21 are specifically \napplicable to this scenario, as well as the requirements for site licensing for new sites. \n \n\uf09f  The licensee wishes to undertake a modification to an existing facility.  Licence \ncondition 22 is specifically applicable to this scenario.  \n \n\uf09f  The licensee is conducting an assessment of structures, systems and components \nfor a periodic safety review.  Licence condition 15 is specifically applicable to this \nscenario. \n \n\uf09f  The licensee wishes to decommission a facility.  Licence condition 35 is specifically \napplicable to this scenario. \n\nEarly regulatory involvement in the design process can provide assurance that the \nnecessary arrangements are in place to ensure safety, as well as provide preliminary \nindications as to whether the final design solution will be satisfactory. \n \nFor new build it may be a vendor who is responsible for design development and \ncontrol prior to the appointment of a licensee.  Under these circumstances the vendor\u2019s \ndesign management process may still be subject to regulatory review, and a regulatory \nstrategy should be developed for this which should take cognisance of the guidance \nprovided in this document. \n\nDesign process \n\n6.6 \n\nThe design process can be a complex undertaking, involving parties from different \ndisciplines who contribute to the overall design product.

Early input from facility operators and \nmaintenance organisations is also necessary.  It is important to recognise the safety \nsignificance of elements of the design to determine the rigour of the safety review.  It \nmust be recognised that the design process is generally iterative, and the key \nrequirement is that the risk associated with the overall functional solution is ALARP.  \nAttempts to justify individual \u2018building blocks\u2019 of the overall design solution to ALARP \ncriteria may not be helpful.  The safety case authors need to keep abreast of the \ndeveloping design solutions and associated detail to ensure that the claims made in \nthe safety case remain valid and accurate.  A typical design process and integrated \nsafety justification should proceed as follows: \n\n\uf09f  Inception and initial brief  \n\uf09f  Feasibility studies and optioneering  \n\uf09f  Conceptual design \u2192 Preliminary Safety Report  \n\uf09f  Scheme design \u2192 Design freeze  \n\uf09f  Detailed design \u2192 Design freeze \u2192 Pre Construction Safety Report  \n\n \n\nIt is necessary that key research and development outputs are available at an early \nstage in the process in order to allow the design to evolve in a logical progression. \n \nThe concept of design freeze is an important control tool in the design process, \nalthough it should be recognised that it does not, and should not impose absolute \nconstraints on changes beyond this point.  However, any such changes to frozen \ninformation should be formally justified and the implications assessed, particularly from \na safety perspective, and thoroughly integrated into the modified design if the change \nis adopted.  The degree of rigour required in the assessment of proposed changes and \n\nReport  NS-TAST-GD-057 \nTRIM Ref: 2017/456576 \n\nPage 6 of 16 \n\n \n \n \n\n\fOffice for Nuclear Regulation  \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n6.8 \n\nthe associated implementation should be commensurate with their associated safety \nsignificance. \n \nIt should be noted in the above description that when the Pre Construction Safety \nReport is produced, the detailed design would generally be \u2018frozen\u2019, making changes \ndifficult from a time and cost perspective.  This reinforces the need for early regulatory \ninterest in the design process.  It is essential that the regulator is made aware of \ndesign changes subsequent to the issue of a licence instrument, as part of the \nregulatory process. \n \nThe design process will also integrate into the overall project management process \nand project sanctioning process.  A number of project \u2018gates\u2019 may need to be \nsuccessfully negotiated for the project to proceed, requiring specific design and safety \ncase deliverables.  Continuity of design resource may be an issue as a result of this \nprocess. \n\nThe design process should also incorporate features known to promote high reliability \nwithin organisational due processes, such as diversity and redundancy. \n\nHazard identification \n\nEarly hazard identification is an important part of design safety assurance and can \nutilise many different inductive and deductive techniques that are undertaken at \nappropriate project design stages.  One standard format is a \u2018structured brainstorm\u2019 to \nidentify hazards, followed by a risk assessment process to quantify the worst credible \nconsequence and associated likelihood, usually expressed as a frequency for \ncumulative risk.  Consequential risks, after the application of safeguards, are then \nassessed and determined to be either intolerable, within the ALARP region, or in the \nbroadly acceptable region.  It is important that identified safeguards, plus other \nmeasures subsequently developed following the hazard identification process are \nrecorded and tracked through to conclusion, to ensure adequate implementation.  A \nhazard schedule, which should be treated as a live document, is generally a good way \nto achieve this. \n\nFundamentally hazards should be eliminated and reduced by design where \npracticable, and most benefit in this respect is usually achieved at the early conceptual \ndesign stage. \n \nIt should be recognised however that although beneficial, document based hazard \nidentification studies are limited in that they sometimes fail to recognise complex \ninteractions between structures, systems and components.  They should therefore be \ncomplemented by other methods of hazard identification such as virtual plant \nwalkdowns, plus actual walkdowns during construction/installation and commissioning. \n \nIt is important that the hazard identification process provides a high degree of \nconfidence that it can identify all credible postulated initiating events. \n \nAs the process develops, further risk assessments should be undertaken in an \nappropriate format to maintain the safety integrity of the design solutions. \n \nThe SAPs FA series (Fault analysis) and WENRA reference level E (Design Basis \nEnvelope for Existing Reactors) are applicable to Hazard Identification. \n\n \n \n \n\n \n\nReport  NS-TAST-GD-057 \nTRIM Ref: 2017/456576 \n\n \n \n \n\nPage 7 of 16 \n\n\fOffice for Nuclear Regulation  \n \n \n\nOptioneering \n\n6.9 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nOptioneering is an essential early part of any design process, in order to ensure and \ndemonstrate that solutions are ALARP.  Optioneering is a very common project \nmanagement technique, but can often focus on issues of cost, functionality and \nprogramme without specifically addressing safety.  The legal requirement to satisfy the \nALARP principle means that options related to safety should be addressed as part of \nthe overall design solution.  However, optioneering needs to be controlled from a \ndesign management perspective during the later detailed design phases in order that \nthe activity can be focused and moved forward, without each step being excessively \nchallenged in detail.  Furthermore, it should be recognised that optioneering at a \nmicroscopic level can be counterproductive and may not generally yield the best \nmacroscopic solution, with a practical economy of effort. \n \nThe SAPs NT series (Numerical targets and legal limits) is applicable to Optioneering. \n\nSafety functional requirements and design parameters \n\n6.10  Safety functional requirements are deterministic rules which are generated during the \nstart of the design activity, which are considered necessary to ensure safety by \nidentifying the specific safety requirements associated with structures, systems and \ncomponents important to safety.  These can cascade from high level safety \nrequirements, to a larger number of lower level functional demands on individual \nstructures, systems and components.  The design should follow these requirements \nand update them as necessary as part of the process.  These requirements should be \nconfirmed during commissioning and then feed in to the operating rules and \ninstructions as described by licence conditions 23 and 24. \n\nAssociated with safety functional requirements is the process whereby design \nparameters are established, to define the design duty of the structures, systems and \ncomponents under consideration.  In addition to categorising / classifying designs in \naccordance with SAPs, physical parameters should be established to define design \nduties, such as temperature, load combinations, damage and aging mechanisms, \nenvironmental considerations, design life considerations etc.  This links to the overall \nconsideration of equipment qualification. \n \nThe SAPs ECS series (Safety classification and standards) and WENRA reference \nlevel G (Safety Classification of Structures, Systems and Components) are applicable \nto Safety Functional Requirements and Design Parameters. \n\nDesign Planning and Organisation \n\n6.11  A well structured and resourced delivery plan/programme is a key part of a well \n\nexecuted design process.  As such it leads directly to ensuring that safety is \nincorporated into the design output, by identifying safety process requirements, such \nas Hazops and safety case integration for example, as well as by facilitating a well \norganised, coordinated process, without which safety cannot be demonstrated and \nindeed may not be achieved.  This plan should identify key inputs, formal design \noutputs, interdependencies, timescales plus resource requirements, generally in terms \nof design effort.  The resource considerations should also address internal design \nskills, internal facilities, external skills and facilities (if consultants are used) plus the \noverall design organisation.  A well structured, up to date and well communicated \ndesign organisation, evidenced through an organisation chart is a prerequisite for an \neffective process. \n\n \n\nReport  NS-TAST-GD-057 \nTRIM Ref: 2017/456576 \n\n \n \n \n\nPage 8 of 16 \n\n\fOffice for Nuclear Regulation  \n \n \n\nDesign activities tend to be organised as either dedicated project teams, with \npersonnel mixed from different technical disciplines, or as small project \nmanagement/engineering groupings drawing on effort from functional teams, \norganised on a discipline basis.  Often organisations operate with a mixture of both \ncharacteristics.  Functional characteristics can bring significant safety assurance \nbenefits in terms of providing collective functional knowledge, robust verification \nprocesses, collective competency and standardisation, but can have the disadvantage \nof discouraging good communication within the project leading to a \u2018silo\u2019 mentality.  \n \nThe design programme should be integrated into the overall project and safety case \nprogrammes, with specific links to procurement and construction/installation to ensure \nan effective overall project is achieved.  It is also important that suitable checks are in \nplace for the review and questioning of input information, such that it is not blindly \nincorporated into the design when it might be erroneous.  This contributes to the \ndefence in depth, which is an inherent feature of a highly reliable process. \n \nWhere design is undertaken at various levels of detail by different organisations, it is \nimportant to recognise that the Design Authority resides at the highest level, with \noverall responsibility for the functionality of the completed design product.   \n\nIt is important that the licensee Design Authority should participate in all interactions \nbetween Responsible Designers and the ONR, in order to ensure that the licensee \ndevelops and maintains this Design Authority capability. \n \nThe design facility makes a significant contribution to an effective design process, and \nsupport resource in terms of personnel and equipment are important factors.  Access \nto technical information is also very important, including availability of historical \ninformation. \n \nOverall design resource numbers, as well as continuity, turnover, training and morale \nare significant issues in terms of design safety assurance.  Training is a particularly \nimportant issue, and should cover not only introduction to new issues, but refresher \ntraining to maintain the \u2018conscious competence\u2019 mode of operation.  Training should \nalso cover physical appreciation of the designed structures, systems and components, \nand application within the intended facility. \n \nThe SAPs MS series (Leadership and management for safety) and WENRA reference \nlevel B (Operating Organisation) are applicable to Design Planning and Organisation. \n\nDesign Standards \n\n \n\n \n\n6.12  Establishing appropriate technical standards to underpin the design process is an \n\nessential early activity, which clearly has significant safety implications.  A range of \nstandards exists for nuclear design application, including IAEA standards, \nInternational, European and British standards as well as in house developed \nstandards, (some with accepted general application with the UK nuclear industry).  It is \nimportant that the design organisations have an up to date knowledge of the range of \navailable standards, and are able to demonstrate a mature selection process for the \nspecific design application.  Selected standards must be effectively communicated \nwithin the design organisation, with training requirements identified and implemented \nas necessary.  Changes to standards must also be effectively assessed, \ncommunicated and implemented, (although a design standards freeze may also be put \nin place). \n\nThe SAPs ECS series (Safety classification and standards) and WENRA reference \nlevel C (Quality Management) are applicable to Design Standards. \n\nReport  NS-TAST-GD-057 \nTRIM Ref: 2017/456576 \n\nPage 9 of 16 \n\n \n \n \n\n\fOffice for Nuclear Regulation  \n \n \n\nDesign verification and validation \n\n6.13  Design verification is the process whereby each stage of the design is confirmed as \n\ncorrect against the requirements from the previous stage.  This generally entails a \nprocess of checking and approval.  Two standard checking methods are usually \napplied, either a direct check of the calculation or design method, following the original \nphilosophy, or alternatively a check by a parallel method or calculation.  Generally the \nparallel method provides for a higher level of assurance, preventing a purely \narithmetical check being undertaken for example, on what may be an erroneous \nphilosophy.  However, a parallel check does not check intermediate results in detail \nand so caution must be applied if these values are subsequently used.  A \ncomplementary method of verification is by comparison with existing, proven design, \nalthough if this is used as the sole method of verification then the process must be \nextremely rigorous.  The assurance of design verification can be categorised by \nassigning a checking category level, ranging from checks within the originating design \nteams, to independent checks undertaken by external organisations. \n\nThe hierarchy of verification is generally undertaken in a three tier structure, with an \noriginator, checker and approver.  The function of the approver from a verification \nperspective is to confirm there are no obvious errors, to ensure that the design output \nis consistent with other design elements, and to confirm the competency of the \noriginator and checker and that the correct level of checking has been applied.  Further \ntiers in the verification process can be counterproductive in diluting the level of \nindividual responsibility and ownership.  Notwithstanding the above, a culture of self \nverification, i.e. \u2018checking your own work\u2019, is evident in the most effective design \norganisations. \n \nDesign validation ensures that the overall intent of the design is achieved, and \nprevents failure of this objective by incremental deviation or dilution.  This is achieved \nby a combination of independent technical assessment, peer review, design review, \nstaged testing and commissioning plus operating trials. \n \nWhere software applications are used in the design process, rigorous software \nvalidation requirements must be in force, including for well structured version control.  \nDesign packages can be bought in externally or developed internally, using a range of \nsoftware platforms, but the fundamental validation requirements are unchanged.  \nWhere commercial design software is used, it may be appropriate to run separate \ndesign codes as a form of validation.  Challenges to the safety assurance of the design \nprocess can readily evolve from the uncontrolled growth and use of small, bespoke \nsoftware routines, which have not been formally validated or controlled.  Software \nshould only be used for analyses within the bounds of its specified application and \nassociated validation, and the results subjected to sanity checks by simplified \ncalculations as necessary.  \n\nThe interface with procurement \n\n \n\n \n\n6.14  The interface with procurement is key to ensuring that the delivered structures, \n\nsystems and components match the design intent.  This requires robust systems for \nidentifying products and materials in the first instance, and inspection systems to \nensure that the material specified is correctly delivered by the supplier (see NS-TAST-\nGD-077 Procurement of Nuclear Safety Related Items or Services).  Inspection \nsystems are also required to verify the engineering functionality and can include type \ntests, batch sample tests plus routine tests (including proof tests).  Tests can be \nundertaken at the factory (Factory Acceptance Tests, FATs) and on site (Site \nAcceptance Tests, SATs), as well as suitable tests on civil structures during the \nconstruction phases (e.g. concrete cube tests). Tests may be destructive or non \n \n \n \n\nReport  NS-TAST-GD-057 \nTRIM Ref: 2017/456576 \n\nPage 10 of 16 \n\n\fOffice for Nuclear Regulation  \n \n \n\ndestructive, and samples from the destructive process should be fully destroyed to \nprevent inadvertent re-use.  It is very important that such tests are well designed such \nthat they mimic as closely as practicable the duties imposed on the structures, systems \nand components on which the design has been based, and meet specified standards \nas necessary.  It should also be noted that there is considerable scope for \nmisunderstanding regarding terminology associated with testing, and the specifications \nand arrangements for testing should be given a commensurate degree of technical \neffort to prevent this, in addition to quality assurance requirements. \n\nArrangements are also required to ensure that non conformances in respect of \nequipment and materials are adequately assessed and sentenced as appropriate.  \nThese arrangements should ensure that the potential non conformance is adequately \nrecognised, categorised in terms of its safety significance, assessed at the correct \nlevel of technical competence and the resulting sentencing adequately implemented.  \nThe aggregate of a series of non conformances should also be captured within the \nprocess, both as evidence of potential systemic process problems, as well as \nidentifying the cumulative effect on safety. \n \nThe SAPs EQU series (Equipment qualification) and WENRA reference level C \n(Quality Management) are applicable to the Interface with Procurement. \n\nThe interfaces between design disciplines \n\n6.15  The interfaces between design disciplines are important from a safety perspective, \n\nspecifically where design covers multidisciplinary areas.  Some form of interdisciplinary \ncheck would be a firm expectation as part of any design process.  Furthermore, in \naddition to processes to control detailed interfaces, it is important that suitably \ncompetent engineers have an overview of the whole designed system to ensure key \nissues are not missed. \n\nInformation control and document management \n\n6.16 \n\nInformation control, configuration control and document management are critical \nrequirements where large numbers of design documents are produced as part of the \nprocess. Licence condition 17 requires adequate arrangements to be made in respect \nof Quality Assurance, QA. Licence condition 6 also requires adequate records to be \nmade in respect of compliance to any licence condition.  Documentation, whether in \nhard copy or electronic format is the fundamental output of any design process and a \nsignificant effort is required to ensure that such information is clear, comprehensive \nand unambiguous.  The following issues are relevant to this subject from a safety \nperspective: \n\n\uf09f  Document identification  \n\uf09f  Version control  \n\uf09f  Presentation format including use of colours  \n\uf09f  Projection methods and orientation  \n\uf09f  Terminology  \n\uf09f  Symbols  \n\uf09f  Distribution  \n\uf09f  Retention and availability of access to lifetime records  \n\uf09f  Production of \u2018as fitted/as built\u2019 records  \n\nWENRA reference level C (Quality Management) is applicable to the issue of \nInformation Control and Document Management. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nReport  NS-TAST-GD-057 \nTRIM Ref: 2017/456576 \n\n \n \n \n\nPage 11 of 16 \n\n\fOffice for Nuclear Regulation  \n \n \n\nChange control \n\n \n\n6.17  The management of change is a key part of the design process, from the early stages \nwhen the process may still be highly iterative, to the later stages where the volume of \ndesign information may be substantial.  An understanding of the way in which the \ndesign information is structured or configured is also important in recognising the \npractical way that agreed changes should be implemented through the design system.  \nThe general principles of design change control and associated configuration \nmanagement are as follows: \n\n\uf09f  Recognition of change  \n\uf09f  Understanding the safety impact of change  \n\uf09f  Agreement of change at the correct authority level  \n\uf09f  Controlled implementation and communication of change  \n\uf09f  Update of necessary documentation  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAs the design matures, agreement and authorisation of change is generally \nundertaken at more senior levels within the organisation.  Once the procurement and \nconstruction cycles have commenced, the impact of potential changes from the design \nprocess are greatly magnified, as are the difficulties in correctly implementing such \nchanges that are agreed.  However, a mindset which automatically resists change due \nto its inherent difficulty will have a negative effect on safety assurance by the possibility \nof failing to recognise and sentence changes which are required. \n \nThe potential impact on safety can be substantial due to incorrect management of \nchanges, which are consequently inadequately conceived and/or executed. \n\nCompetency \n\n6.18  Licence condition 12 requires that only Suitably Qualified and Experienced Persons, \n\n(SQEPs), should perform any duties that may affect safety.  This requirement also \naffects designers and so the design resource should be subject to a competency \nmanagement system.  This system should recognise the skills, technical discipline and \nexperience of the designers and design management should ensure that activities are \nonly undertaken by suitably qualified and experienced personnel. \n\nWENRA reference level B (Operating Organisation) is applicable to the issue of \nCompetency. \n\nThe interface with construction/installation \n\n6.19  The design process should clearly link to the construction/installation process, such \n\nthat adequate information is provided to the construction teams, and a process should \nbe established whereby queries raised by these teams can be fed back and assessed \nby the designers.  The use of field engineers with design office experience is \nrecommended to fulfil this interface function.  Recognition of changes requiring design \nreview is fundamental.  Licence conditions 19 and 20 have particular relevance to this \nissue. Arrangements are necessary in this area to ensure that non conformances are \nrecognised, assessed at the correct level and duly sentenced by a controlled process. \n\nThe interface with commissioning \n\n6.20  The design process should also link to the commissioning process, such that adequate \ninformation is provided to the commissioning teams, and a process should be \nestablished whereby queries raised by these teams can be fed back and assessed by \nthe designers. The use of commissioning engineers with design office experience is \nrecommended to fulfil this interface function, with suitable input from future operators \n\nReport  NS-TAST-GD-057 \nTRIM Ref: 2017/456576 \n\nPage 12 of 16 \n\n \n \n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\nOffice for Nuclear Regulation  \n \n \n\nas part of the process. Recognition of changes requiring design review is fundamental.  \nLicence condition 21 has particular relevance to this issue. Arrangements are \nnecessary in this area to ensure that non conformances are recognised, assessed at \nthe correct level and duly sentenced by a controlled process.  \n\nThe commissioning process should confirm the assumptions made and requirements \nidentified through the design process. \n \nThe SAPs ECM series (Commissioning) is applicable to the Interface with \nCommissioning. \n\nThe Interface with Maintenance and Inspection \n\n6.21  The design process should identify the requirements for examination, inspection, \nmaintenance and testing of structures, systems and components as necessary to \nassure their continued safe operation.  Due regard should be made during the design \nprocess to visibility and accessibility of structures, systems and components to meet \nthis requirement. Specific attention should also be paid to facilitate the replacement of \nitems which are intended to be renewed within the design life of the overall facility.  \nLicence condition 28 has particular relevance to this issue. \n\nThe SAPs EMT series (Maintenance, inspection and testing) and WENRA reference \nlevel K (Maintenance, In-service inspection and Functional Testing) are applicable to \nthe Interface with Maintenance and Inspection. \n\nSafety case production and interface \n\n6.22  The design process must lead to production of safety documentation that achieves the \nnecessary level of assurance and reference should be made to the relevant BMS \nguidance. \n\nGenerally the safety case format should follow the claim, evidence, argument logical \njustification chain, whereby the design process should seek to primarily provide \nevidence in terms of design information and parameters. \n \nWhere existing facilities are subject to upgrade programmes, then establishing a firm \nunderstanding of the present state of the facility and original design intent is an \nimportant input into the design and safety case production activities.  Where this \ninformation is not readily available, this can be achieved as part of formalised \nengineering substantiation processes. \n \nThe SAPs SC series (Safety cases) and WENRA reference level N (Contents and \nupdating of Safety Analysis Report) are applicable to Safety Case Production and \nInterface. \n\nDesign review \n\n6.23  Design review is a core requirement of any quality management system.  At suitable \n\nplanned stages, formal reviews should be undertaken to confirm the validity of the \ndesign, to act as a forum for information transfer and to identify problem areas and to \ngive direction to solutions.  It is important that such reviews are given a high level of \nsupport and importance, with participation from procurement and \nconstruction/installation disciplines where practicable.  Typically a design review \nshould ensure the following: \n\n\uf09f  The requirements of the brief have been identified and are being met  \n\uf09f  Appropriate design acceptance criteria have been established and are being met  \n\nReport  NS-TAST-GD-057 \nTRIM Ref: 2017/456576 \n\nPage 13 of 16 \n\n \n \n \n\n\fOffice for Nuclear Regulation  \n \n \n\n\uf09f  The safety justification process is integrated into the design process  \n\uf09f  Correct design parameters have been established  \n\uf09f  The design identifies appropriate materials and products  \n\uf09f  Appropriate and referenced design documentation is being produced  \n\uf09f  The design identifies suitable limits and conditions of operation and safety  \n\nDesign instructions \n\n6.24  Formal procedures should be in place to ensure that design instructions, including \n\nthose issued to installation teams which are not captured by other suitable documents, \nare put in place.  Such instructions are often generated from the need for direction in \nadvance of formal incorporation into other design generated documentation.  \nNevertheless, these instructions should be formally generated, verified as appropriate \nand adequately controlled and distributed.  It would be expected that they be \nincorporated into other formal documentation at an appropriate stage. \n\nFault Recording and Corrective Action Systems \n\n6.25  Formal processes should be in place to ensure that design associated faults and \n\npotential improvements identified from procurement, construction, installation, \ncommissioning plus final operation and maintenance are fed back to the designers for \nconsideration.  This process is sometimes termed a Fault Recording and Corrective \nAction System.  This consideration should generally follow the following model: \n\n\uf09f  Record and understand the fault  \n\uf09f  Identify what action is required for existing designs/materials/installations on the \nproject  \n\uf09f  Identify what action is required for future designs/materials/installations on the \nproject  \n\uf09f  Identify what changes to design processes may be necessary for the future in \ngeneral  \n\nFrom an overall perspective, \u2018lessons learned\u2019 workshops can provide a valuable \nlearning format to ensure that difficulties are minimised for the future.  These \nworkshops should also identify positive features, as well as areas for improvement, to \nensure that good practice is repeated in the future. \n \nWENRA reference level J (System for Investigation of Events and Operational \nExperience Feedback) is applicable to the issue of Fault Recording and Corrective \nAction Systems. \n\nIntelligent Customer and Design Authority \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n6.26  The design knowledge should be retained in a form that is practically retrievable and \n\nunderstandable for the lifetime of the facility\u2019s operational and decommissioning \nperiods.

This role of \nDesign Authority and Intelligent Customer capability extends to the review of third party \ndesign consultants where they are used by the non licensee design house \n(Responsible Designer), as well as the interfaces with procurement and \nconstruction/installation. \n\nReport  NS-TAST-GD-057 \nTRIM Ref: 2017/456576 \n\nPage 14 of 16 \n\n \n \n \n\n\fOffice for Nuclear Regulation  \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nReference should be made to NS-TAST-GD-079, which addresses ONR\u2019s \nexpectations for existing and prospective licensees\u2019 Design Authority capability. \n \nWENRA reference level C (Quality Management) is applicable to the issue of \nIntelligent Customer and Design Authority. \n\nHuman factors \n\n6.27  Human factors are an important consideration for the design process.

Furthermore, since \nthe mindset is generally one of ensuring that configurations do successfully work, \ndesigners sometimes fail to question how they could be misused or fail, in terms of \nsystematically assessing what could go wrong at a detailed level. \n\nHuman factors input should be made to the design process to ensure that demands on \noperators to operate the equipment, maintain it and respond to failures are adequately \nassessed.  Physical as well as theoretical models can play an important part in linking \nthe design concepts to human factors issues, in terms of the final configuration. \n \nWhere necessary, guidance should be sought from specialist human factors \npractitioners. \n \nThe SAPs EHF series (Human factors) is applicable to the issue of Human Factors. \n\nDesign quality assurance \n\n6.28  Design activities must be internally regulated by current and controlled quality \n\nassurance procedures which are accessible to all users.  These procedures should be \nenforced by a visible internal auditing regime, with evidence of observations and \ncorrective action requirements as appropriate.  As with all quality assurance auditing \nprocesses, there should be evidence of effective action and close out of issues to \ndemonstrate a robust process. \n\nWENRA reference level C (Quality Management) is applicable to Design Quality \nAssurance. \n\nDesign for decommissioning \n\n6.29  Design solutions should take due recognition of the need for future decommissioning \n\nof facilities and equipment.  This may include the need to replace equipment which \nbecomes life expired, within the overall facility design life, in addition to \ndecommissioning the facility as a whole.  It should be recognised that the attributes \nwhich may provide straightforward decommissioning may run counter to those which \nare necessary to ensure safety during the operational lifetime of the facility, e.g. \nseismic capability may require substantial structural engineering solutions, which are \nchallenging to decommission.  Recognition of the future requirement however at the \ndesign stage will allow the optimum solution to be achieved, whilst ensuring safety at \nall stages.  Licence condition 35 has specific relevance to this issue. \n\nThe SAPs DC series (Decommissioning) is applicable to the issue of Design for \nDecommissioning. \n \n\nReport  NS-TAST-GD-057 \nTRIM Ref: 2017/456576 \n\nPage 15 of 16 \n\n \n \n \n\n\fOffice for Nuclear Regulation  \n \n \n\n7. \n\nSUMMARY \n\n7.1 \n\nThis guidance has been produced to advise the reader of key elements within a design \nprocess for items important to safety, primarily for application within the nuclear \nenvironment. \n\nThe detailed features of the design process itself will vary between disciplines and \nprojects, but this document addresses the key elements which should be present in an \neffective design organisation that produces design solutions that will be demonstrably \nsafe.

The \nprinciples presented in the SAPs are supported by a suite of guides to further assist \nONR\u2019s inspectors in their technical assessment work in support of making regulatory \njudgements and decisions. This technical assessment guide is one of these guides. \n\n2. \n\nPURPOSE AND SCOPE \n\nThis Guide gives guidance to ONR inspectors on ONR\u2019s use of its eight fundamental \nsafety assessment principles, in the assessment of licensees\u2019 safety cases, as set out \nin ONR Safety Assessment Principles for Nuclear facilities (SAPs) FP.1-FP.8 [1]. These \nare high-level principles, and the demonstration that they have been met can be shown \nby meeting the more detailed SAPs. This Guide does not itself aim to summarise or \nreproduce material in the Guides relating to the more detailed SAPs, but it indicates \nthe broad intentions of the fundamental principles and some background \nconsiderations. Assessors should also take account of the general guidance in the \nIntroduction to SAPs.  \n\n2.2 \n\nAs with all guidance, inspectors should use their discretion in the depth and scope to \nwhich they apply this guidance in the exercise of their professional judgement in \nreaching regulatory decisions. \n\n3. \n\nRELATION TO LICENCE AND OTHER RELEVANT LEGISLATION \n\n3.1 \n\nSite licence conditions \n\nAs the Fundamental Principles are overarching principles to be applied throughout the \nSAPs then the 36 conditions attached to the standard site licence will be relevant. \nHowever, seven are of particular relevance to the SAPs covered in this guide. \nThese are: \n\n1.  LC 10 (Training),  \n2.  LC 11 (Emergency Arrangements),  \n3.  LC 12 (Duly Authorised and other Suitably Qualified and Experienced \n\nPersons), \n\n4.  LC 14 (Safety Documentation),  \n5.  LC 23 (Operating rules), \n6.  LC 26 (Control and supervision of Operations),  \n7.  LC 36 (Control and Organizational Change).  \n\n3.2 \n\nThe Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974 (HSWA) \n\nThe Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974 (HSWA) [2] sets out fundamental legal \nrequirements concerning health and safety related to work activities in the UK. HSWA \nplaces duties on employers to ensure the health, safety and welfare of their employees \n(Section 2) and to conduct their operations so that persons not in their employment are \nnot exposed to risks to their health and safety (Section 3). The employer is required to \nensure that these duties are met \"so far as is reasonably practicable\". This principle, \nabbreviated to SFAIRP, is therefore the basic legal requirement with which employers \nmust comply. ALARP (As Low As Reasonably Practicable) and SFAIRP require the \nsame tests to be applied and are effectively the same thing, though the terms are not \ninterchangeable in legal proceedings which must employ the wording in the legislation.  \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\nReport : NS-TAST-GD-004 Revision 7 \nCM9 Ref: 2019/0101578 \n\nPage 2 of 8 \n\n\fOffice for Nuclear Regulation  \n \n \n\n3.3 \n\nIonising Radiations Regulations 2017 and Approved Code of Practice (ACoP) \n\nThe Ionising Radiations Regulations 2017 [3] (IRR17) specify the statutory \nrequirements for the protection of persons against ionising radiation and are supported \nby an ACoP and guidance [4]. A facility must be designed, operated and \ndecommissioned in compliance with these legal provisions. Aspects of particular \nrelevance to the Fundamental Principles are highlighted in the following regulations \nand associated ACoP & Guidance in L121.  \n \n\n\uf0b7  Reg 8 \u2013 Radiation risk assessments \u2013 before work is undertaken every employer \n\nmust carry out a risk assessment to identify the hazards and evaluate the risks to the \nworkforce and to others. It should be noted that regulation 3 of the Management of \nHealth and Safety at Work Regulations 1999 \nassessment to be reviewed and kept up-to-date. \n\n(MHSWR) [5] requires the risk \n\n\uf0b7  Reg. 9 - Restriction of exposure \u2013 this requires every employer, in relation to any \n\nwork with ionising radiation that he undertakes, to take all necessary steps to restrict \nso far as is reasonably practicable the extent to which his employees and other \npersons are exposed to ionising radiation. The means of achieving this is the primary \nobjective of the safety submission on radiological protection and all SAPs are relevant \nto judging the extent to which exposures are restricted by the licensee. \n\n \n\n \n\n\uf0b7 \n\n Reg. 13 \u2013 Contingency Plans \u2013 this requires the employer, where an assessment \nmade in accordance with regulation 8 shows that a radiation accident is reasonably \nforeseeable, to prepare a contingency plan designed to secure, so far as is reasonably \npracticable, the restriction of exposure to ionising radiation and the health and safety of \npersons who may be affected by such accident. \n \nRadiation (Emergency Preparedness and Public Information) Regulations 2001 \n(REPPIR) and its Guide [6]. \n\n3.4 \n\nREPPIR 2001establishes a framework for the protection of the public by means of \nemergency preparedness for radiation accidents with the potential to affect members \nof the public at premises and during specified transport operations. It also specifies \nrequirements for the provision of information to the public: in advance in situations \nwhere a (REPPIR 2001) radiation emergency might arise; and in the event of any kind \nof radiation emergency (however it may arise). \n \nNote that REPPIR 2019 is expected to come into force during 2019. \n\n \nThe Energy Act 2013 (TEA13). [7]. \n\n3.5 \n\nThe Energy Act 2013 (TEA13), http://services.parliament.uk/bills/2012-13/energy.html, \nwhich established the Office for Nuclear Regulation and specified its functions, came \ninto force on 1st April 2014. The Nuclear Installations Act 1965 (as amended) (NIA) [8] is \na Relevant Statutory Provision (RSP) under TEA13.  \n\n3.6 \n\nThe Nuclear Installations Act 1965 (as amended) (NIA) [8]. \n\nThe NIA prohibits the operation of certain facilities unless such facilities are licensed \nunder the terms of the Act. It allows for the attachment of Licence Conditions that may \nbe necessary or desirable in the interests of safety. The standard Nuclear Site Licence \nhas 36 conditions; under TEA13 these are now applicable provisions. The duties in \nvarious Licence Conditions to make and implement adequate arrangements are \nabsolute and not qualified by SFAIRP. \n\n \n\nReport : NS-TAST-GD-004 Revision 7 \nCM9 Ref: 2019/0101578 \n\n \n \n \n\nPage 3 of 8 \n\n\fOffice for Nuclear Regulation  \n \n \n\nRelevant SAPs \n\n4. \n\nRELATION TO SAPS, WENRA REFERENCE LEVELS AND IAEA SAFETY \nSTANDARDS  \n\n4.1 \n\nThe SAPs covered by this TAG are FP.1 to FP.8 and the supporting paragraphs 47-52. \n\n4.2 \n\n4.3 \n\n4.4 \n\n4.5 \n\n4.6 \n\n4.7 \n\nFP.1, \u2018Responsibility for safety\u2019 - The prime responsibility for safety must rest with the \nperson or organisation responsible for the facilities and activities that give rise to \nradiation risks. This principle reflects the need for there to be a clear responsibility for \nsafety in any workplace. For nuclear installations the main responsibility rests with the \nlicensee, as defined in the Nuclear Installations Act 1965 (as amended) (NIA65). It \nshould however be borne in mind that other persons in relation to nuclear licensed \nsites, tenants or the owners of sites, may have responsibilities for safety under the \nprovisions of HSWA. For facilities not on nuclear licensed sites, it rests with the \nemployer/dutyholder. \n\nFP.2, \u2018Leadership and management for safety\u2019 - Effective leadership and management \nfor safety must be established and sustained in organisations concerned with, and \nfacilities and activities that give rise to, radiation risks. This principle is further \ndeveloped in the SAPs section with that title and in corresponding ONR guidance. It \nfollows from FP.1 and recognises the crucial importance of leadership and \nmanagement, including safety management systems, in achieving and maintaining a \nsafety culture for positive safety outcomes. \n\nFP.3, \u2018Optimisation of protection\u2019 - Protection must be optimised to provide the highest \nlevel of safety that is reasonably practicable. This principle is directly related to the \nfundamental requirement of HSWA that risks must be controlled and reduced SFAIRP. \n\u2018Protection\u2019 in the present context means measures to reduce the exposure of persons \n(workers and public) to ionising radiation, from both normal operation of facilities and \naccidents, including consideration of future generations. The principles in the SAPs are \nalways subject to ALARP considerations. \n\nFP.4, \u2018Safety assessment\u2019 - Dutyholders must demonstrate effective understanding \nand control of the hazards posed by a site or facility by means of a comprehensive and \nsystematic approach to safety assessment. This relates to the dutyholder\u2019s processes \nfor the generation of safety cases. These are the means by which dutyholders \ndemonstrate an understanding of the hazards associated with their facilities and the \nmeans by which they are to be controlled. The principles for safety cases are \ndeveloped in the SAPs section on \u2018the regulatory assessment of safety cases\u2019. \n\nFP.5, \u2018Limitation of risk to individuals\u2019 - Measures for controlling radiation risks must \nensure that no individual bears an unacceptable risk of harm. This reflects the basic \naim of those parts of IRR17 which set statutory limits on the exposure of individuals to \nionising radiation. In addition, there are non-statutory limits targeted at limiting the risk \nto people. See for example SAPs paragraphs 698-700 and 706-709. \n\nFP.6, \u2018Prevention of accidents\u2019 - All reasonably practicable steps must be taken to \nprevent and mitigate nuclear or radiation accidents. This is assessed against the SAPs \nrelating to design and operation, and demonstrated in safety cases on system \nrobustness and accident analysis. Many of the SAPs, for example EKP.3 \u2018Defence in \ndepth\u2019, are aimed at this objective. Mitigation covers both the on-site response to make \nsafe any plant involved in an accident, and measures taken to protect individuals on \nand off-site. \n\n4.8 \n\nFP.7, \u2018Emergency preparedness and response\u2019 - Arrangements must be made for \nemergency preparedness and response in case of nuclear or radiation incidents. This \n\nReport : NS-TAST-GD-004 Revision 7 \nCM9 Ref: 2019/0101578 \n\nPage 4 of 8 \n\n \n \n \n\n\fOffice for Nuclear Regulation  \n \n \n\nrelates to the requirements of the Radiation (Emergency Preparedness and Public \nInformation) Regulations 2001 (REPPIR01) for the protection of people on and off-site \nin the event of an emergency with the potential to give rise to radiation doses above a \ncertain threshold. It also considers responses made under IRR17 regulation 13. \n\n4.9 \n\nFP.8, \u2018Protection of present and future generations\u2019 - People, present and future, must \nbe adequately protected against radiation risks. This principle recognises that the \nhazard from radioactivity may be long-lived and widespread. This means that the \npossible consequences, now and in the future, of current actions have to be taken into \naccount in judging the adequacy of measures taken to control radiation risks. In \naddition it recognises that there may be risks of genetic detriment to future \ngenerations, as well as somatic detriment to exposed individuals. \n\n4.10  Satisfying the fundamental principles is the main aim of all other principles in the SAP. \n\nThese fundamental principles should therefore be kept in mind when assessing all \nsafety submissions because they establish the overall framework and underlying \nphilosophy for safety that should be used in ONR safety assessment. \n\nWENRA safety reference levels \n\n4.11  The objective of the Western European Nuclear Regulators Association (WENRA) is to \ndevelop a common approach to nuclear safety in Europe by comparing national \napproaches to the application of IAEA safety standards. Their Safety Reference Levels \n(SRL) [9], which are primarily based on the IAEA safety standards, represent good \npractices in the WENRA member states and also represent a consensus view of the \nmain requirements to be applied to ensure nuclear safety in operating facilities. The \nSRL are not set at the fundamental principle level, so there is no one-to-one \ncorrespondence with them and this guide, however, this guidance is generally \nconsistent with them. \n\nIAEA safety standards \n\n4.12  The IAEA Safety Standards, Fundamental Safety Principles, Safety Fundamentals No. \n\nSF-1 [10] and supporting documents are relevant to the Fundamental Principles in the \nSAPs. The objective of SF-1 is to establish the fundamental safety objective, safety \nprinciples and concepts that provide the bases for the IAEA\u2019s safety standards and its \nsafety-related programme. Related requirements are established in the General Safety \nRequirements publications. Guidance on meeting these requirements is provided in \nthe related Safety Guides. \n\n4.13  The IAEA have established 10 safety principles. Of these 7 are relevant to the SAPs \n\nFundamental Principles. The relation between the Fundamental Principles in the SAPs \nand those in SF-1 are as follows: \n\nFP.1 relates to IAEA Principle 1, \nFP.2 relates to IAEA Principle 3, \nFP.3 relates to IAEA Principle 5, \nFP.4 relates to IAEA Principle 5, \nFP.5 relates to IAEA Principle 6, \nFP.6 relates to IAEA Principle 8, \nFP.7 relates to IAEA Principle 9, and \nFP.8 relates to IAEA Principle 7. \n\n4.14 \n\nIt should be noted that IAEA Fundamental Safety Principles 2 (legal framework), 4 \n(justification) and 10 (unregulated radiation risks) are outside the scope of the SAPs. \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\nReport : NS-TAST-GD-004 Revision 7 \nCM9 Ref: 2019/0101578 \n\nPage 5 of 8 \n\n\fOffice for Nuclear Regulation  \n \n \n\n5. \n\nADVICE TO ASSESSORS \n\n5.1 \n\nDuties predicated on the \u2018reasonably practicable\u2019 test in HSWA and its relevant \nstatutory provisions are open to interpretation by dutyholders and regulators alike. This \nis because it is a test that is not expressly defined in criminal law but rather a \ndetermination made in accordance with relevant case law when proceedings are \nbrought before a court in this matter. In this regard, courts are strongly directed by a \nlegal precedent established in 1949 in \u201cEdwards V. The National Coal Board\u201d which, \non appeal, led to the following verdict on the meaning of \u2018reasonably practicable\u2019: \n \n\u201cReasonably practicable is a narrower term than \u2018physically possible\u2019 and implies that a \ncomputation must be made... in which the quantum of risk is placed in one scale and \nthe sacrifice involved in the measures necessary for averting the risk (whether in time, \ntrouble or money) is placed in the other and that, if it be shown that there is a great \ndisproportion between them \u2013 the risk being insignificant in relation to the sacrifice \u2013 \nthe person upon whom the obligation is imposed discharges the onus which is upon \nhim.\u201d \n \nIt should be noted that the standard of proof that courts apply in such cases is the civil \nlaw test of \u2018balance of probability\u2019 rather than the test of \u2018beyond all reasonable doubt\u2019 \nand that the burden of proof rests with the defendant rather than the prosecution. \n \nSAPs paragraphs 9-18 give general guidance on the philosophy of \u2018reasonably \npracticable\u2019, which underlies the HSWA phraseology SFAIRP and the effectively \nequivalent term ALARP. The term As Low As Reasonably Achievable (ALARA) is used \ninternationally and is taken to be equivalent to ALARP allowing for social and \neconomic factors. Assessors should be familiar with the SAPs general guidance and \nthe documents referred to therein. Aspects specific to nuclear safety are developed \nfurther in NS-TAST-GD-005 supported by; Reducing Risks, Protecting People: HSE\u2019s \ndecision making process (R2P2) [11] and the 6 ALARP guides published on the HSE \nwebsite.  \n\nThe FPs are drafted as requirements, using the word \u2018must\u2019, reflecting their relation to \nlegal requirements. Most of the other SAPs use \u2018should\u2019 or similar (exceptions being \nthose SAPs which contain statutory requirements). The use of \u2018should\u2019 reflects the \nflexible nature of health and safety law where \u2018reasonably practicable\u2019 takes account of \nthe nature and scale of hazards and risks. This also allows the possibility of different \nequivalent or better alternatives to the safety provisions indicated in SAPs and \nguidance. See SAPs Introduction, paragraphs 14-18 and 27-30 regarding ALARP and \nproportionality. \n\nGuidance on FP.1 regarding dutyholder responsibilities is given in the document \n\u2018Licensing Nuclear Installations\u2019. \n\nIn the application of FP.2, Leadership and management for safety, the assessor should \ntake account of the Principles MS.1 to MS.4 and the guidance given in paragraphs 53-\n78 of the SAPs. Additional guidance can be found in the TAG related to Leadership \nand Management for safety NS-TAST-GD-093 Revision 1 Guidance for undertaking \nLeadership and Management for Safety Reviews. \n\nFP.4 emphasises the need for the dutyholder (i.e. licensee on nuclear licensed sites) \nto understand the hazards and their control, and to demonstrate such understanding. \nThis includes evidence that the dutyholder is an \u2018intelligent customer\u2019 for any \ninformation supplied by another party which is relevant to a safety case. Guidance on \n\u2018intelligent customer\u2019 is given in NS-TAST-GD-049 Licensee Core and Intelligent \nCustomer Capabilities. \n\n5.2 \n\n5.3 \n\n5.4 \n\n5.5 \n\nReport : NS-TAST-GD-004 Revision 7 \nCM9 Ref: 2019/0101578 \n\nPage 6 of 8 \n\n \n \n \n\n\fOffice for Nuclear Regulation  \n \n \n\n5.6 \n\n5.7 \n\n5.8 \n\n5.9 \n\nIn order to demonstrate an effective understanding of the hazards of a facility and their \ncontrol, and thus satisfy FP.4, the safety assessment in the safety case should include \nboth deterministic and probabilistic analyses as complementary approaches to the \ndemonstration of safety. \n\nAn apparent adherence to the quantitative risk criteria is not sufficient on its own to \nestablish that a situation is acceptably safe. Similarly, cost/benefit analysis may help to \nsupport a case, but very careful scrutiny is needed if it is invoked to support non-\nadherence to well-established good practice. In general, probabilistic and cost/benefit \narguments are easier to accept when the variation from current good practice is also \nevidently safer according to deterministic analysis. The Design Basis Analysis (DBA) \nwould be used to guide the engineering requirements of the design. However, DBA \nmay not be sufficient, on its own, to demonstrate the adequacy of the safety of a facility \nand should be complemented by suitable and sufficient Probabilistic Safety Analysis \n(PSA) and Severe Accident Analysis (SAA) to give a comprehensive demonstration of \nfacility safety performance. Further information can be found in NS-TAST-GD-051 The \nPurpose, Scope and Content of Nuclear Safety Cases.  \n\nIn meeting FP5, IRR17 provides statutory limits on radiation doses that correspond to \nthe upper limit in the three-zone approach to risk judgements as set out in The \ntolerability of risks from nuclear power stations (TOR) [12] and R2P2 [11] (see SAPs \nparagraphs 9-11). FP.3 on \u2018Optimisation of protection\u2019 should be applied to reduce \npotential dose levels below the dose limits and to demonstrate ALARP. The SAPs \nsection on Radiation Protection, and associated guidance, indicate what is expected \nfor such optimisation. \n\nIn relation to FP.5 and FP.8 it should be noted that off-site doses from authorised \ndisposals of radioactive waste from nuclear sites, including discharges to air and to \nbodies of water, are regulated by the Environment Agency (England), Natural \nResources Wales (Wales) and Scottish Environment Protection Agency (Scotland). \nAppropriate liaison should be done in accordance with HSE/ONR\u2019s memoranda of \nunderstanding with such bodies.  \n\n5.10  To satisfy FP.5, limitation of risks to individuals, the SAPs paragraphs 695-758 contain \n\nseveral types of numerical dose and risk criteria, mostly expressed as \u2018Basic Safety \nLevels\u2019 (BSL) and \u2018Basic safety Objectives\u2019 (BSO) and presented as Targets rather \nthan Principles. Where the \u2018levels\u2019 are IRR17 statutory limits on doses to the workforce \nand the public they are designated \u2018Legal Limits\u2019 (LL). Dose limits and risk targets at \nthe BSL/LL level represent an upper bound that ONR expects a new facility or activity \nto meet. However, they are insufficient in themselves to ensure the best reasonably \npracticable protection in any given circumstances. They therefore need to be \ncomplemented by optimisation of protection as required by FP.3. Thus both limitation \nof dose and optimisation of dose below that limit, for normal operations, are necessary \nto achieve the required level of safety. \n\n5.11  Principle FP.6 addresses both accident prevention and mitigation. Mitigation is \n\nregarded as the last level of defence-in-depth, discussed in \u2018engineering principles: key \nprinciples Defence in depth, EKP.3\u2019 of the SAPs; but it should not be invoked to justify \na relaxation or reduced benefit from earlier levels. The safety assessment (FP.4) \nshould include analysis of potential accidents to indicate a basis for the planning of \naccident management and emergency response (FP.7). \n\n5.12 \n\nIn respect of FP.7, the assessor is referred to SAPs paragraphs 768ff and principle \nAM.1 together with its supporting paragraphs. Generally speaking the arrangements \nrequired by FP.7 are addressed through various licence conditions, especially LC11. \n\nReport : NS-TAST-GD-004 Revision 7 \nCM9 Ref: 2019/0101578 \n\nPage 7 of 8 \n\n \n \n \n\n\fOffice for Nuclear Regulation  \n \n \n\n5.13  Relevant to FP.8 are the criteria in SAPs paragraphs 712-758 relating to accidents \n\nwhich includes in paragraph 756, that stochastic health effects from long-term doses \nshould be integrated up to a time of 100 years and be restricted to the UK population. \nThe SAPs on radioactive waste management, decommissioning and land quality \nmanagement are also relevant to the long-term protection of people. \n\n5.14  The other SAPs are aimed at ensuring that the fundamental principles are satisfied. If it \n\nis judged that the totality of SAPs relevant to a particular installation have been met, \nthis should be sufficient to satisfy inspectors that the installation meets the \nfundamental principles. For example, if a plant is adequately robust (that is, the \ntechnical principles are satisfied SFAIRP, so giving suitable and sufficient defence in \ndepth) and if the plant is operated safely (that is, in accordance with the FP.2 \nrequirements plus the site licence requirements) then the \u2018accident prevention\u2019 part of \nFP.6 is deemed to have been satisfied. \n\n6. \n\nREFERENCES \n\n1.

The \nconcept of SFAIRP is normally expressed in terms of reducing risks to \u201cAs Low As \nReasonably Practicable\u201d (ALARP), the terms SFAIRP and ALARP being synonymous \nin guidance documents. \n\nThis TAG is part of a sequence of documents, headed by \u201cReducing Risks, Protecting \nPeople\u201d [R2P2] and the series of ALARP Guides for use by health and safety \ninspectors published on our websites. It is intended that ONR inspectors make use of \nall these documents when considering licensees' cases or arguments. \n\nThe requirement for risks to be ALARP is fundamental and applies to all activities \nwithin the scope of the Health and Safety at Work (etc) Act 1974 [HSWA]. It is \nimportant that inspectors in whatever role are aware of the need to ensure that \nlicensees meet this requirement where it applies. In simple terms it is a requirement to \ntake all measures to reduce risk where doing so is reasonable. In most cases this is \nnot done through an explicit comparison of costs and benefits, but rather by applying \nestablished relevant good practice and standards. The development of relevant good \npractice and standards includes ALARP considerations so in many cases meeting \nthem is sufficient. In other cases, either where standards and relevant good practice \nare less evident or not fully applicable, the onus is on the licensee to implement \nmeasures to the point where the costs of any additional measures (in terms of money, \ntime or trouble \u2013 the sacrifice) would be grossly disproportionate to the further risk \nreduction that would be achieved (the safety benefit). \n\nTo aid use of this TAG in regulatory activities, a checklist is provided in Annex 1 which \nreferences back to the appropriate text in the main body of the TAG. It is recognised \nthat it is unlikely that all of the check points in Annex 1 will apply in any single case \u2013 \ninspectors will need to select those that are appropriate to the specific circumstances. \n\n2. \n\nPURPOSE AND SCOPE \n\nThe purpose of this Technical Assessment Guide (TAG) is to provide advice to ONR \ninspectors to help them judge whether a licensee has met the requirement to reduce \nrisks to ALARP. As such, the TAG is intended to be used for all ONR regulatory \nfunctions relating to nuclear safety falling within the remit of the HSWA.  \n\n3. \n\nRELATIONSHIP TO LICENCE AND OTHER RELEVANT LEGISLATION \n\nHSWA provides the basic legislation for health and safety related to work activities. \nThe HSWA places duties on employers to ensure the health, safety and welfare of \ntheir employees (Section 2) and to conduct their operations so that persons not in their \nemployment are not exposed to risks to their health and safety (Section 3). The \nemployer is required to ensure that these duties are met \"so far as is reasonably \npracticable\". This principle, abbreviated to SFAIRP, is therefore the basic legal \nrequirement to which an employer needs to conform. ALARP (the term used in \nHSE/ONR guidance) and SFAIRP require the same tests to be applied and are \neffectively the same thing, though the terms are not interchangeable in legal \nproceedings (which must employ the wording in the legislation). \n\n                                                 \n1 Hereafter, in the interests of brevity, \u201clicensee\u201d should be interpreted as meaning licensee or dutyholder as \nappropriate to the circumstances \n\nReport : NS-TAST-GD-005 Revision 10 \nCM9 Ref: 2019/315236 \n\nPage 2 of 29 \n\n \n \n\n\fOffice for Nuclear Regulation  \n \n \n\n3.2 \n\n3.3 \n\n3.4 \n\n3.5 \n\n3.6 \n\nThe parts of the Nuclear Installations Act we are concerned with became Relevant \nStatutory Provisions of the Energy Act 2013, rather than HSWA, on 1 April 2014; the \nimpacts of this and related changes do not affect the guidance in this TAG.  \n\nIt is important to recognise that not all the legal duties licensees need to meet are \nqualified by SFAIRP \u2013 so ONR\u2019s ALARP guidance should only be applied where this \nqualification is in place.  For example, the duties in various Licence Conditions, which \nare now applicable provisions of the Energy Act 2013, to make and implement \nadequate arrangements are not qualified by SFAIRP. \n\nNevertheless, the demonstration of ALARP will normally be made within the licensee\u2019s \nsafety case required under Licence Condition 23.  The need to demonstrate ALARP \nalso arises in other legislation.  For instance, specific legal requirements in relation to \nradiation protection are contained in the Ionising Radiation Regulations 2017 [IRR], \nwhich put into UK law the 2013 Basic Safety Standard Directive. IRR Regulation 9 \nrequires that exposure should be restricted SFAIRP. Other relevant legislation is \ncontained in the Management of Health and Safety at Work Regulations 1999, which \nrequires a suitable and sufficient risk assessment, and in the Control of Major Accident \nHazards Regulations 1999 [COMAH]. \n\nThis TAG is written against the background of R2P2\ndocuments published on the Internet which give guidance to health and safety \ninspectors on ALARP. This TAG extends the wider guidance to specific aspects of how \nONR operates, the use of a licensing regime and other ONR guidance on inspection \nand assessment. Thus R2P2, the Internet guides (listed below) and this TAG taken \ntogether represent ONR guidance to our inspectors on ALARP.  \n\n [1] and the supporting \n\nThis document assists in implementing Council Directive 2014/87/Euratom of 8 July \n2014 amending Directive 2009/71/Euratom, by highlighting ONR\u2019s regulatory \nexpectations regarding the achievement of nuclear safety and as reference for the \ntimely implementation of reasonably practicable safety improvements (see Articles \nbelow) by nuclear site licence holders and, in particular, demonstrating that the IAEA \nand WENRA Safety Objectives and Reference Levels underpin the UK\u2019s regulatory \noversight of nuclear safety (See Section 4 and paragraph 4.6.)  \n\nArticle 8a Nuclear safety objective for nuclear installations  \n\n8a (1) Member States shall ensure that the national nuclear safety framework requires \nthat  nuclear  installations  are  designed,  sited,  constructed,  commissioned,  operated \nand  decommissioned  with  the  objective  of  preventing  accidents  and,  should  an \naccident occur, mitigating its consequences and avoiding:  \n\n(a)  early  radioactive  releases  that  would  require  off-site  emergency  measures \nbut with insufficient time to implement them;  \n\n(b) large radioactive releases that would require protective measures that could \nnot be limited in area or time. \n\n8a (2) Member States shall ensure that the national framework requires that the \nobjective set out in paragraph 1:  \n \n\n(a) applies to nuclear installations for which a construction licence is granted for \nthe first time after 14 August 2014;  \n\n \n\n(b) is used as a reference for the timely implementation of reasonably \npracticable safety improvements to existing nuclear installations, including in \nthe framework of the periodic safety reviews as defined in Article 8c(b). \n\nReport : NS-TAST-GD-005 Revision 10 \nCM9 Ref: 2019/315236 \n\nPage 3 of 29 \n\n \n \n\n\fOffice for Nuclear Regulation  \n \n \n\n3.7 \n\nR2P2 sets out HSE's overall framework for decision-making to aid consistency and \ncoherence across the full range of risks falling within the scope of the HSWA. This \nframework represents our risk management policy and is based on \"The Tolerability of \nRisks from Nuclear Power Stations\" (TOR)\n published in 1992 [2]. TOR defines risks \nwhich are so high they are unacceptable unless there are exceptional circumstances, \nand risks which are so low that they may be considered broadly acceptable so that in \nmost cases it would be disproportionate to apply regulatory time to reduce them \nfurther. Between these levels inspectors should consider whether risks have been \nreduced to ALARP, while recognising that the legal duty for risks to be ALARP is not \nlimited to this range.  \n\n3.8 \n\nR2P2 explains our decision making process rather than providing guidance to \nindividual dutyholders. The approach is essentially risk-based and R2P2 addresses the \nqualitative and quantitative role of risk assessment and the key role of good practice in \ndetermining control measures. Based on legal precedent, R2P2 considers risk to \ninclude the \"possibility of danger\", though the terminology used in our guidance calls \nthings that present the possibility of danger \u201ca hazard\u201d. \n\n3.9 \n\nThe HSE ALARP guides published on the Internet (colloquially known as \u201cthe ALARP \nsix-pack\u201d) are: \n\n3.10  PRINCIPLES AND GUIDELINES TO ASSIST HSE IN ITS JUDGEMENTS THAT \n\nDUTYHOLDERS HAVE REDUCED RISK AS LOW AS REASONABLY PRACTICABLE [3] \nThis paper defines ALARP and SFAIRP and sets out in plain terms what HSE believes \nthe law requires. \n\n3.11  ASSESSING COMPLIANCE WITH THE LAW IN INDIVIDUAL CASES AND THE USE OF \n\nGOOD PRACTICE [4] This paper defines what HSE means by good practice and lists \nthe responsibilities of Operating Directorates (which includes ONR) in respect of \nidentifying and maintaining records of good practice. \n\n3.12  POLICY AND GUIDANCE ON REDUCING RISKS AS LOW AS REASONABLY \n\nPRACTICABLE IN DESIGN [5]. This paper recognises the importance of taking account \nof health and safety in design and sets out HSE's intervention policy with respect to \ndesign. At licensed sites, intervention in the design is controlled by licence conditions \nattached under the powers of the NIA, and is a well established process (see \nT/AST/051 [25] and Nuclear Site Licensees Notes for Applicants\nSites, HSWA Section 6 and the Construction, Design and Management Regulations \n2007 [CDM] should be used. \n\n [6]).

This \n\ndocument summarises HSE's view of what should and should not be considered in a \ndutyholder's CBA for health and safety ALARP determinations. \n\n3.16  NIA provides for ONR to attach Licence Conditions to a site licence in the interests of \n\nsafety and with respect to the handling, treatment, and disposal of nuclear matter. \nLicence Condition 14 requires arrangements to \"produce and assess safety cases .... \nto justify safety\" and Licence Condition 23 requires an adequate safety case be \nproduced and that the facility is then operated in accordance with that safety case. \nThese safety cases still need to address the duty to reduce risks to ALARP from \nHSWA. \n\nReport : NS-TAST-GD-005 Revision 10 \nCM9 Ref: 2019/315236 \n\nPage 4 of 29 \n\n \n \n\n\fOffice for Nuclear Regulation  \n \n \n\n3.17  Under the IRRs, the licensee has to carry out a risk assessment prior to commencing \n\nwork with ionising radiation, review progress during the job (for example tracking a \ndose budget) and consider plant, procedures and training aspects.  A prime aim of \nthese prior risk assessments, along with demonstrating legal limits on exposure etc. \nwill be complied with, should be to ensure the risks, particularly those due to expected \nradiological exposures from the planned activities, will be reduced to ALARP. \n\n3.18  Many decisions on what is needed to meet ALARP for conventional (i.e. non-\n\nradiological) safety are made at the time regulations are being written and judgements \nof acceptability can therefore often be made directly against the requirements of those \nregulations (although the legal duty to reduce risks SFAIRP still remains). \n\n4. \n\n4.1 \n\n4.2 \n\n4.3 \n\nRELATIONSHIP TO SAPS, WENRA REFERENCE LEVELS AND IAEA SAFETY \nSTANDARDS ADDRESSED \n\nThe SAPs [10] were developed against the background of the legal requirements and \nthe TOR philosophy, and have been benchmarked against the IAEA Safety Standards. \nThey contain engineering and operational principles, safety analysis requirements and \nnumerical targets and legal limits. The need to demonstrate risks are ALARP is an \noverriding and all-embracing requirement. Paragraph 16 of the SAPs emphasises that \n\"The principles are used in helping to judge whether reducing risks to ALARP is \nachieved.......\u201d. This has not been stated in each case to avoid excessive repetition\". \nFurthermore it is also a requirement of SAPs that \"priority should be given to achieving \nan overall balance of safety rather than satisfying each principle or making an ALARP \njudgement against each principle\". The expectation from SAPs is that a safety case \n(see T/AST/051 [25]) should provide an analysis of normal operation, potential faults \nand accidents, and of the engineering design and operations, and demonstrate the \nrisks from all these perspectives have been reduced to ALARP. \n\nThe TOR philosophy has been translated into nine Numerical Targets in the form of \nBasic Safety Levels (BSLs) and Basic Safety Objectives (BSOs) (see SAPs para \n695ff). It is however, essential that these are applied against a background of good \nengineering and operational practice. The BSOs represent broadly acceptable levels \nbelow which regulatory resources will generally not be used to seek further \nimprovements, and where assessors should confine themselves to considering the \nvalidity of the arguments presented (SAPs para 701). This is a pragmatic approach to \nenable targeted and proportionate use of our resources; it is not a green light for \nlicensees to forego ALARP considerations at such levels. \n\nIt is ONR policy that a new facility or activity should at least meet the BSLs (note that in \na few cases the BSLs are legal limits derived from IRRs - these are designated as \nBSL(LL) in SAPs). All the other Targets are policy guidance for inspectors and are not \nmandatory. Older facilities may have been designed and constructed to different safety \nstandards and deterioration over time now means that BSLs are exceeded. In these \ncases, provided the BSL is not a legal limit, it may be reasonable for operation to \ncontinue if:  \n\ni) it has been shown that no reasonably practicable options are available to reduce \nrisks further in the short term; and  \n\nii) a clear longer-term plan to manage and reduce risks within as short a period as \nreasonably practicable is in place.  \n\n4.4 \n\nThe criteria for determining whether an explicit ALARP demonstration is required in \nrelation to the Engineering SAPs, which represent ONR's views of relevant good \npractice, are not set out in numerical terms. Instead, if the relevant SAP is evidently \nwell satisfied, then the facility should be considered to be meeting the equivalent of the \nTOR broadly acceptable criterion on that particular point and therefore there is unlikely \n\nReport : NS-TAST-GD-005 Revision 10 \nCM9 Ref: 2019/315236 \n\nPage 5 of 29 \n\n \n \n\n\fOffice for Nuclear Regulation  \n \n \n\n4.5 \n\n4.6 \n\n \n\n5. \n\n5.1 \n\n5.2 \n\nto be a need for further assessment against ALARP.  Conversely, any non-\nconformance with relevant good practice should be explicitly highlighted and then \njustified as reducing risks to ALARP within the safety case. \n\nThe hierarchy of safety measures set out in the Engineering Key Principles (EKP 1-5 \nand supporting guidance, particularly SAPs para 155) will usually be a key part of the \nALARP analysis. Essentially the SAPs approach is to seek solutions as near to the top \nof the following list as possible: avoid the hazard; design to achieve fault tolerance; \nmaintain safe conditions by passive means rather than active systems; initiate \nprotection automatically in preference to manually; and mitigate fault consequences. \nThis philosophy is also embodied in para 8 of HSE's ALARP in Design paper [5].  \n\nIn addition to SAPs, the IAEA Safety Standards and the Safety Reference Levels \ndeveloped by WENRA for reactors, decommissioning, and the storage of radioactive \nwaste and spent fuel [21] should be considered to be UK relevant good practice. IAEA \nSafety Standards are developed by international consensus and were used to \nbenchmark the  SAPs [10]  The WENRA Reference Levels for reactors are much more \nspecific and only apply to existing civil nuclear reactors. However, the \ndecommissioning safety reference levels are relevant good practice for all types of \nnuclear facilities and cover all stages in the lifecycle.  The storage reference levels \napply to facilities where radioactive waste or spent fuel is stored for a significant period \nof time.  The UK, as a member of WENRA, has formally signed on to the Reference \nLevels and, in line with ONR\u2019s enforcement policy [22] in relation to relevant good \npractice, we expect them to be followed. WENRA\u2019s safety objectives for new nuclear \npower plants [26] and guidance on timely implementation of reasonably practicable \nimprovements to existing nuclear power plants [27] are also considered to be UK \nrelevant good practice.    \n\nADVICE TO INSPECTORS \u2013 GENERAL POINTS \n\nTo aid use of this TAG in regulatory activities, a checklist is provided in Annex 1 which \nreferences back to the appropriate text in the main body of the TAG. It is recognised \nthat it is unlikely that all of the check points in Annex 1 will apply in any single case \u2013 \ninspectors will need to select those that are appropriate to the specific circumstances. \n\nOur current advice [3] is that the essence of a demonstration that risks have been \nreduced ALARP is to show that the \"costs\" (sacrifice) of improving safety any further \nwould be grossly disproportionate to the safety benefits that would accrue from \nimplementing any identified improvement compared to the status quo. This does not \nmean that a detailed analysis is necessary: the emphasis must be on an analysis \nwhich is fit for purpose. Neither does it mean that a quantitative argument based on \nrisk estimates is always necessary, as qualitative features such as applying \ndeterministic engineering principles may be sufficient in making a case. However, ONR \ninspectors should seek suitable and sufficient Probabilistic Safety Analysis (PSA) in \naddition to deterministic analysis for systems where there are significant hazards and \ncomplexity. Assessing an ALARP demonstration is essentially a consideration of \nwhether an adequate argument has been made that a further reduction in risk would \nnot be feasible at a reasonable cost, given the magnitude of the risk. However where \nthere are several risks which interact, whether arising from a single hazard or from \ndifferent connected hazards, there may be a need for balancing to achieve the best \noverall solution. \n\n5.3 \n\nDemonstration of ALARP requires the licensee to evaluate the risks and to consider \nwhether it would be reasonably practicable to implement further safety measures \nbeyond the initial proposals or what is currently in place. This ought to include the \nconsideration of a number of options to identify which is the reasonably practicable \n\nReport : NS-TAST-GD-005 Revision 10 \nCM9 Ref: 2019/315236 \n\nPage 6 of 29 \n\n \n \n\n\fOffice for Nuclear Regulation  \n \n \n\noption or collection of options that give the best safety benefit, and making this \nconsideration transparent. In reality there may only be a limited number of options for \ndealing with a particular health and safety issue. However, features such as: good \npractice that HSE may have accepted as relevant good practice; an option adopted \nelsewhere in similar circumstances; and the extent to which this option has worked in \npractice, often provide strong indications of what the ALARP solution might be. \n\n5.4 \n\nThe following represent principles which are likely to need addressing in most cases: \n\n1  The application of ALARP can only be to risks which the licensee controls (e.g. it is \nnot  a  requirement  for  nuclear  power  plant  operators  to  consider  other  forms  of \nelectrical generation).  \n\n2  Affordability, i.e. whether a company is in a position to fund improvements, is not a \nlegitimate  factor  in  the  ALARP  argument,  though  the  cost  of  implementing  the \nimprovement is. \n\n3  ALARP cannot be used to argue against fulfilling statutory duties. \n\n4  The ALARP argument needs to consider all the types of risk that are relevant, not \njust  the  nuclear  /  radiological  ones,  and  where  these  conflict  with  one  another, \nensure  that  an  appropriate  overall  balance  is  achieved  in  regard  to  their \nmanagement. \n\n5  ALARP  demonstrations  ought  to  consider  all  the  various  options  which  could \nrealistically  improve  safety,  and  then  implement  the  option  or  combination  of \noptions which achieves the lowest level of residual risk provided this is reasonably \npracticable (para 50 of the HSE ALARP Principles [3]). It is not adequate to start with \nthe cheapest option first.  \n\nSimilarly,  inspectors  should  be  alert  to  disproportionate  consideration  of  \u2018deluxe\u2019 \noptions  that  involve  excessive  cost  being  used  to  argue  that  there  are  no \nreasonably practicable improvements. The timescale for implementation may be a \nfactor in the choice of the ALARP option, so due consideration should be given to \nless effective options that might be implemented with shorter lead times, especially \nwhere the risks are high or the resultant hazard reduction is significant.  \n\nIn  more  complex  situations,  licensees  will  have  to  select  an  option  taking \ncognisance  of  all  relevant  legislation  such  as  safety,  environmental  and  security. \nSection 6.6.4 provides guidance on developing an optimised solution where there \nare both safety and environmental duties to be met.  \n\n6  Existing  facilities  should  be  compared  against  relevant  modern  standards, \nincluding  those  not  in  force  when  they  were  designed  /  constructed.  The  safety \ncase  should  consider  the  importance  of  any  shortfalls  and  what  options  exist  for \nimprovement,  again  starting  with  the  safest,  and  then  consider  the  reasonable \npracticability  of  implementing  them.  Older  facilities  may  meet  the  ALARP \nrequirement  at  higher  risks  than  new  ones  (para  52  of  the  HSE  ALARP  Principles \n[3]). \n\n7  The  ALARP  case  should  be  fit  for  purpose.  If  the  risks  are  high  then  the \ndemonstration of ALARP needs to be more rigorous than if the risks are low. The \ndegree  of  rigour  should  also  depend  on  the  consequence  level.  For  higher \nconsequence  situations  the  consequences  should  weigh  more  heavily  than  the \nfrequency  estimates.  Furthermore,  thought  should  be  given  to  the  robustness  of \nthe conclusions with respect to uncertainties and to any assumptions employed in \nthe demonstration. \n\n8 \n\nIf  the  ALARP  demonstration  employs  a  comparison  of  costs  and  risk  reduction \nbenefits  to  rule  out  an  improvement,  then  based  on  our  current  guidance  [3],  it \nmust  be  shown  that  the  costs  (sacrifice)  of  the  improvement  would  be  \"grossly \ndisproportionate\"  (see  Cost  Benefit  Analysis  Principles  [7]).  The  law  does  not \n\nReport : NS-TAST-GD-005 Revision 10 \nCM9 Ref: 2019/315236 \n\nPage 7 of 29 \n\n \n \n\n\fOffice for Nuclear Regulation  \n \n \n\nrecognise an acceptable region other than when ALARP has been met so there is \nunlikely to be any sympathy in the courts for parity of costs and benefits, even at \nthe TOR Broadly Acceptable level. Advice from HSE lawyers is that, provided the \nrisk is more than fanciful, the courts would still seek \"gross disproportion\". It is also \ntrue  that,  depending  on  circumstances,  future  health  and  safety  court  cases  may \nlead  to  a  change  in  interpretation  of  SFAIRP  and  subsequently  HSE  and  ONR \nguidance  on  this  matter.  However  until  such  time  we  will  continue  to  follow  our \nexisting guidance. \n\ni)  There  is  however,  no  precise  legal  factor  or  HSE  algorithm  for  gross \ndisproportion.  For  the  purposes  of  this  TAG,  it  is  suggested  that  the \nevidence  given  by  John  Locke,  then  Director  General  of  HSE,  at  the \nSizewell  B  Public  Inquiry  provides  a  starting  point.  Although  this  evidence \nwas  produced  some  time  ago,  no  subsequent  legal  proceedings  or  public \ninquiries  have  countered  these  views  or  provided  alternatives.  In  his \nevidence,  Locke  suggested  a  gross  disproportion  factor  of  up  to  3  for \nworkers. For risks to the public, he added that the factor would depend on \nthe level of risk, and where the risks were low (consequence and likelihood) \na  factor  of  about  2  was  suggested,  whereas  for  higher  risks  the  factor \nshould be about 10. \n\nii)  The Health Protection Agency (HPA, now Public Health England) produced \nguidance  relating  to  the  dose  saved  resulting  from  routine  exposure  or \nminor  accidents  i.e.  stochastic  effects,  up  to  about  100  mSv.  This \nrecommends  that  an  increasing  multiplier  is  used  as  the  dose  increases \nand  comparison  of  licensees  submissions  with  this  approach  may  be \nvaluable as part of our assessments [11]. \n\niii) \n\nIn view of these precedents, it is suggested that a factor of less than 10 in \nthe vicinity of a BSL is unlikely to be acceptable and, for hazards that can \ncause large consequences, the factor may need to be larger still. \n\n \n\n6. \n\n6.1 \n\nADVICE TO INSPECTORS \u2013 DETAILED REQUIREMENTS \n\nRelevant Good Practice \n\nALARP demonstrations should consider first and foremost factors relating to \nengineering, operations and the management of safety. These expectations are often \nreferred to by the general term \"relevant good practice\".  Based on HSE [4], relevant \ngood practice is \"\u2026 those standards for controlling risk which have been judged and \nrecognised by HSE as satisfying the law when applied to a particular relevant case in \nan appropriate manner.\" In nuclear safety applications, where the potential \nconsequences of accidents can be very serious, the best practice identified as \nappropriate to the application would normally be required for new designs. Annex 2 \ncontains further guidance on the application of ALARP for new civil nuclear reactors in \nthe context of Generic Design Assessment [20]. Annex 3 contains responses to a \nnumber of RGP frequently asked questions.  \n\n6.2 \n\nFor an existing facility, relevant good practice is established by using the standards \nthat would be applied to a new design as a benchmark and then subjecting any \nshortfalls to the test of reasonable practicability. Unless the sacrifice entailed in moving \ntowards the benchmark is grossly disproportionate to the safety benefit, the licensee \nshould make that move. \n\n6.3  What is accepted as relevant good practice may change over time because of \ntechnological innovation which improves the degree of control, cost impact of \nimprovements or knowledge about the hazard. For existing facilities in Periodic Safety \nReviews (PSRs), the facility should be compared with the benchmark of modern \n\nReport : NS-TAST-GD-005 Revision 10 \nCM9 Ref: 2019/315236 \n\nPage 8 of 29 \n\n \n \n\n\fOffice for Nuclear Regulation  \n \n \n\n6.4 \n\n6.5 \n\n6.6 \n\n6.7 \n\nstandards (see T/AST/050 [23] on PSRs for more information). Due account should \nthen be taken when considering compliance and the reasonable practicability of \nimprovements, of aspects such as the age of the facility, its future lifetime, future \noperations and the degree and importance of any shortfall. \n\nIn terms of specific sources of relevant good practice for the nuclear industry there are \nseveral legal requirements which must be met and in some cases ACoPs (Approved \nCodes of Practice) and Guidance have been issued (e.g. the ACoP to the IRRs [12]) to \nassist the licensee in achieving compliance. \n\nStandards exist for many engineering and operational features and it is a feature of \nnew designs that licensee proposals may be based on non-UK standards. Such \nstandards should be subject to assessment to ensure they represent appropriate \nrelevant good practice in a UK context. There are also several international bodies \nwhich produce standards or guidance documents: where the UK is tied by international \nagreements, e.g. EU, the standards have the same status as UK ones; where such \nagreements do not exist, the guidance may be considered as authoritative, but \nsubsidiary to UK requirements.  In a nuclear context, IAEA Safety Standards and the \nSafety Reference Levels developed by WENRA for reactors, decommissioning, and \nthe storage of radioactive waste and spent fuel [21] should be considered to be \nrelevant good practice. \n\nONR inspectors should use the SAPs together with the associated TAGs to judge \nwhether licensees' claims for relevant good practice are justified. As the TAGs are \nrevised they will be updated in line with the SAPs and will also include explicitly the \nWENRA Reference Levels that are relevant to the TAG in question. Similarly ONR \nguidance on inspection (TIGs) provides the means by which many day-to-day relevant \ngood practice decisions are made, e.g. in regard to operational safety.  \n\nAnother important source of relevant good practice in the nuclear industry is what is \ndone on similar facilities. Many licensees have established their own standards \nreflecting good practice that are acceptable to ONR. However in invoking past practice \nit is important to be clear whether the practice remains relevant and whether it was \nimplemented for safety reasons. In reaching a decision to implement measures to \nreduce risks, licensees sometimes take into account additional factors that are not \ndirectly safety related (e.g. lower insurance premiums, enhanced commercial \nreputation etc). It is important that inspectors do not take such factors into account \nwhen considering whether licensee precedents represent relevant good practice (see \npara 19 of R2P2\n\n appendix 3). \n\n6.8 \n\nIn many cases licensees will claim that the implementation of a particular relevant \ngood practice or standards is sufficient to demonstrate ALARP. In assessing such \nclaims inspectors should apply SAPs ECS.3 to ECS.5 and EQU1 (paras 169 to 177) \nand in particular may consider: \n\n\uf0b7 \n\n\uf0b7 \n\nthe  good  practice  or  standard  should  be  relevant  to  the  specific  application, \nplant, facility or industry in question. \n\nthe  good  practice  or  standard  should  be  up-to-date,  taking  account  of  the \ncurrent state-of-the-art: any practice or standard more than a few years old, or \nnot  subject  to  active  ongoing  monitoring  and  review  or  not  written  by \nacknowledged experts may be suspect. \n\n\uf0b7 \n\nthe  good  practice  or  standard  should  not  be  in  the  form  of  a  minimum \nrequirement.  \n\n\uf0b7  where  a  good  practice  or  standard  allows  for  more  than  one  option,  these \n\nshould be tested to determine those which are reasonably practicable. \n\nReport : NS-TAST-GD-005 Revision 10 \nCM9 Ref: 2019/315236 \n\nPage 9 of 29 \n\n \n \n\n\fOffice for Nuclear Regulation  \n \n \n\n\uf0b7 \n\nthe  good  practice  or  standard  should  include  explicitly  all  relevant  factors, \nparticularly  relating  to  assumptions  on  the  standards  of  contingent  systems  or \ninputs/outputs.  Standards  and  good  practice  may  relate  to  single  Systems, \nStructures and Components and further consideration may need to be given to \npossible interactions. \n\n\uf0b7 \n\nthere  should  be  no  doubt  about  the  applicability  of  the  good  practice  or \nstandard to the case in point. \n\n \n\n6.9 \n\nExplicit Comparisons \n\nDeciding what is reasonably practicable involves the exercise of judgement and \nenforcing authorities will generally expect relevant good practice to be followed. Where \nrelevant good practice in particular cases is not clearly established, health and safety \nlaw effectively requires dutyholders to establish explicitly the significance of the risks to \ndetermine what action needs to be taken. Where it is not possible to demonstrate \nALARP by good practice features and risk estimates alone, the benefits of risk \nreducing measures should be compared with their costs. Sometimes it is helpful to use \na common unit, which is generally money, so that the analysis may become a form of \nCost Benefit Analysis (CBA). The degree of quantification is case dependent, but must \nbe sufficient to make the case fit for purpose. In particular, a CBA is unlikely to be \nconsidered an adequate argument on its own that a situation is ALARP [14]. The \nfollowing paragraphs give further brief guidance on quantitative approaches, on \nnumerical estimation of risks, and on the application of CBA and other quantitative \napproaches. Further guidance to inspectors is provided in HSE's generic Principles for \nCBA [7] the CBA Checklist [9]; HSE's policy in regard to CBA is summarised in \nAppendix 3 of R2P2  [1] and paragraphs 101-108 of its main text. \n\nRisk Estimation \n\n6.10  The outline of a quantitative case is relatively straightforward. The benefit requires two \n\nestimates of risk: one before the implementation of the improvement and one after. \nThe safety benefit of the improvement is the incremental difference in risk between the \ntwo estimates in terms of the detriments (i.e. all the adverse consequences) and their \nlikelihoods, summed over the remaining life of the facility. It is anticipated that a broad \ncomparison of these benefits and the costs of the improvement can in many cases \nlead to a decision without needing to translate the risk reduction into monetary terms. \nIn other cases the detriments may need to be expressed in terms of money to compare \nwith the costs of the improvement.  \n\n6.11  The level of risk without the improvement sets the starting point on the risk scale and \n\nso influences the gross disproportion factor (see para 5.4 (8) and [9]). The selection of \nan appropriate gross disproportion factor will also depend on the robustness of the \nanalysis and so should be one of the parameters varied in sensitivity studies.  \n\n6.12  Where a CBA is employed, inspectors should verify that the scope of the CBA is \n\nsufficient and comprehensive. In particular, there should be a process of systematic \nidentification and assessment of benefits and detriments, supported by a suitable \nsensitivity analysis.  \n\n6.13  The use of CBA for comparing the sacrifice from making improvements against the \n\nsafety benefits gained is part of the regulatory process followed during the production \nof new regulations by HSE and other government departments. Less well developed is \nthe use of CBA in decision making within the type of goal-setting regulation which ONR \nuses. TOR  [2] Appendix 3 considers the application of CBA to nuclear safety \nassessment and concludes that whilst it may be useful in some circumstances (e.g. \nwhere quantification can be obtained without disproportionate effort or excessive \n \n \n\nReport : NS-TAST-GD-005 Revision 10 \nCM9 Ref: 2019/315236 \n\nPage 10 of 29 \n\n\fOffice for Nuclear Regulation  \n \n \n\nuncertainty), it was not feasible, at the time of writing to develop a CBA \"rule book\" \napproach that can be applied mechanistically. Principles for CBA [7] further \nacknowledges that HSE has no algorithm to determine this factor, which needs to be \nset on a case-by-case basis.  Subsequent regulatory experience (since TOR) suggests \nthere would be little benefit in ONR developing such a \u201crule book\u201d in view of the types \nof safety case arguments we normally see and the overriding need for licensees to \nconsider relevant good practice as the starting point for their risk assessments. Cost \nscreening can be a useful aid to help decide if more needs to be done; justified risk \nestimates are used together with reasonable accident cost estimates, to provide an \nindication of the amount worth spending to remove the risk. If this amount is low, even \ntaking account of potential uncertainties and gross disproportion, compared with the \ncost of any realistic risk reduction measures, then it can be a useful indicator that no \nfurther risk reduction is needed.   \n\n6.14 \n\nIn calculating the accident risk it is important that all the changes in risks due to the \npotential modification are accounted for (see also para 17 of the HSE ALARP Principles \n[3]). It is important to be sure that licensees do not understate the value of the benefit \nfrom the improvement by limiting the analysis to only the most severe of risks.  \nAssessors should therefore check that licensees have not masked potential \nimprovements which would affect non-dominant risks by considering only changes to \nthe overall risk: all possible risk reductions should be viewed on their own merits. \n\n6.15  Some quantitative arguments may involve balancing risks, for example implementation \nof  a  modification  to  reduce  risk  to  the  public  might  lead  to  a  dose  uptake  during  the \nwork,  and  hence  a  transfer  of  risk.  Although  TOR   [2]  gives  the  tolerable  individual \nrisk to a worker as ten times higher than that to the general public, this should not be \ninterpreted  to  imply  that  risks  to  different  groups  should  be  valued  differently  for \nALARP  purposes  (see  paras  37  &  38  of  the  HSE  ALARP  Principles  [3]).  The  issue  of \nbalancing  risks  may  also  need  to  involve  cooperation  with  other  agencies  (e.g.  the \nEnvironment  Agency  &  Scottish  Environment  Protection  Agency  (SEPA))  if  some  of \nthe  risks  are  associated  with  authorised  discharges,  protecting  the  environment  or \ndisposal of radioactive waste. The Environment Agency employs the concept of \u201cBest \nAvailable  Techniques\u201d  (BAT)  to  establish  the  appropriate  levels  of  protection  and \nSEPA use \u201cBest Practical Means\u201d BPM. In reality BAT and BPM require dutyholders to \nfollow a very similar process of balancing to that used in ALARP determinations. This \nis discussed further in para 6.36.  \n\nValuation of Detriments \n\n6.16  Valuation of detriments is still a subject of much discussion and research. HSE uses a \nfigure [9] of \u00a31.5million (2009) for the Value of Preventing a statistical Fatality (VPsF). \nIn the case of death caused by cancer, HSE has taken the view that people are \nprepared to pay a premium and R2P2 says that a higher figure, twice the above should \nbe used. It is suggested here that this premium is also appropriate for all radiation \ndeaths. However, continuing research has questioned the validity of applying a \npremium, and so it is possible that the premium may be removed at some future date.  \nNoting that in most cases a factor of 2 will not have any material effect on what is / is \nnot reasonably practicable given the uncertainties generally prevalent in CBA, this \naspect will not normally be important.  However, in the unlikely case that including this \nfactor is the pivotal aspect in determining whether an improvement reduces risks to \nALARP, inspectors should seek the advice of the relevant ONR Professional Lead as \nto the current status of the research into this area. \n\n6.17  Accidental releases of radioactive material may lead to widespread contamination off \nand within the facility or site. Off-site it will lead to other safety-related detriments such \nas evacuation, relocation, land interdiction and food bans. Attempts to cost all of these \nhave been made by licensees both for reactors and for chemical plant, based on the \nHPA (now Public Health England) model COCO-1 [15].  An updated model, COCO-2 \n\nReport : NS-TAST-GD-005 Revision 10 \nCM9 Ref: 2019/315236 \n\nPage 11 of 29 \n\n \n \n\n\fOffice for Nuclear Regulation  \n \n \n\n[16], published in 2008, takes account of the current UK economic structure, considers \nsome of the economic effects of an accident in more detail and includes some \nadditional sources of loss.  COCO-2 now represents the benchmark when the costing \nof detriments is part of the ALARP demonstration.   \n\nCosts of Implementation \n\n6.18  A more difficult area for assessment may well be estimating the costs (sacrifice) of the \nmodification as these may require a knowledge of both the engineering design and the \ncosts of components etc. It is likely that the full engineering details of the modifications \nwill not be available so that accurate costings will be difficult.  \n\n6.19 \n\nIn considering the sacrifice, it is important that only those costs relating to health and \nsafety improvements are included. The costs considered should be only those \nnecessary and sufficient for the purpose of reducing the risk and not be for \"deluxe\" \nmeasures where cheaper \"standard\" measures are available. \n\n6.20  Of all the cost factors, the loss of revenue is particularly problematic as it can lead to a \nparadox: If a plant shutdown is required to implement an improvement, a high revenue \nearning plant may be able to show it is not reasonably practicable to implement an \nimprovement which a lower revenue plant would otherwise have implemented. \nNevertheless ONR accepts that shutdown costs constitute a legitimate part of the \nsacrifice and it is valid to include them. To avoid undue influence of this factor, \nlicensees should have considered the phasing of the implementation. For example, it \nmay be reasonable to delay implementation until a planned or other outage. \nFurthermore, in some circumstances it may be established relevant good practice to \nshutdown to enable implementation of the improvement, and in such cases these costs \nwill have already been implicitly accounted for. Where this is the case, a CBA-based \nargument against implementing established good practice is unlikely to be acceptable. \n\n6.21  Any discounting of costs and benefits into the future should follow standard Treasury \n\nrules, with due allowance made for up-rating benefits to take into account predicted \nfuture improvement in living standards. For further information relating to the \napplication of discount rates, inspectors are referred to 'The Treasury Green Book' [18], \nwhich describes the appraisal and evaluation of Government funded projects. \n\n6.22  When reviewing proposals to reduce the risks posed by an existing facility, there will \n\noften be a delay before implementing improvements, for example arising from the need \nto design/manufacture equipment. This raises questions regarding how to take this \nintervening period into account. In such cases, the extent of the original shortfall \nagainst ALARP should be based on the future life of the facility etc at the time the \nsafety case is made, and not the (shorter) remaining life following implementation. \nHowever, the evaluation of the benefits arising from the improvement may take \naccount of the time to implement. In addition, consideration of the risks during the \nperiod prior to implementation should apply the Time at Risk guidance discussed \nbelow.  \n\n6.23  The purpose of this part of the TAG is to consider some of the applications of the \n\nALARP principle which can lead to contentious situations and/or difficult decisions. \n\n  \n\nDifficult Areas \n\n          Uncertainties \n\n6.24  One of the difficulties in making a robust quantitative argument is that many of the \n\nfactors, both in determining the sacrifice and safety benefits, are subject to sizeable \nuncertainties. Hence in making a case, particularly where it uses quantitative methods, \nsensitivity studies to test the robustness of the arguments should always be provided. \n\nReport : NS-TAST-GD-005 Revision 10 \nCM9 Ref: 2019/315236 \n\nPage 12 of 29 \n\n \n \n\n\fOffice for Nuclear Regulation  \n \n \n\nParagraphs 89 to 93 of R2P2\nprecautionary approach in the face of uncertainty, i.e. assume that precautions should \nbe taken unless there is a good reason to think that the risk is insignificant (see also \nSAPs para 30). \n\n and appendix 1 of R2P2 recommend the use of a \n\n \n\nTime at Risk Situations \n\n6.25  The Numerical Targets set out in SAPs are (mostly) given as frequencies based on \nannual averages. Circumstances will arise where a higher risk will exist for shorter \nperiods of time that make the use of annualised frequency targets inappropriate. \n\n6.26  There are three principal situations in which licensees may argue the acceptability of \n\nincreased risk for a short period to justify not spending resources to improve safety to a \nlevel that would be reasonably practicable for continuous, long-term operation: \n\nThrough  Life  -  Where  a  short-term  increased  risk  is  needed  for  continued \nnormal  operation  of  the  facility.  Examples  here  include  undertaking  certain \nmaintenance  activities,  temporary  disconnection  of  safety  measures  to  allow \ncompletion of essential tasks or other intermittent activities that are required to \nsustain production. \n\nResidual Facility Life - As a facility ages, its safety margins may be eroded, for \nexample due to ageing effects, or its risks may appear high when compared to \nnewer  facilities  designed  to  more  modern  standards.  Licensees  may  however \ninvoke arguments that these risks are acceptable because the short remaining \noperating life of the facility means that significant investment is unreasonable. \n\nEnd  of  Life  Legacy  \u2013  Clean-out  and  decommissioning  may  necessitate  short \nperiods  of  increased  levels  of  risk  compared  to  those  from  previous  normal \noperations.  Licensees  may  argue  this  is  unavoidable  if  remediation  of  the \nfacility is to be completed. \n\n \n\n  Through Life Risk \u2013 Specific Considerations \n\n6.27  The guidance below is intended to provide an overall policy against which to assess \nwhether a licensee has made an adequate demonstration that all reasonably \npracticable measures to control any short-term elevated risk have been taken. Due to \nthe large number of possible reasons for elevated short-term risk, judging whether \nthese requirements have been met for a specific situation however needs to be done \non a case to case basis: \n\n1. \n\n2. \n\n3. \n\nSAPs  Principle  NT.2  states  that  there  should  be  sufficient  control  of \nradiological  hazards  at  all  times.  Any  period  in  which  the  risk  is  elevated, \nwhatever  the  situation,  must  be  subject  to  a  specific  demonstration  that \nrisks  are  controlled  ALARP.  The  period  of  this  elevated  risk  should  be  as \nshort as reasonably practicable (SAPs para 762). \n\nIn considering NT.2, the demonstration of  \u2018sufficient  control of radiological \nhazards\u2019  should  include  explicit  consideration  of  defence-in-depth  levels 1 \nto  4  (SAPs  Principle  EKP.3),  and  the  hierarchy  of  such  measures  (SAPs \nPrinciple EKP.5).  \n\nThe  short-term  risk,  when  annualised,  should  not  exceed  BSLs  except  in \nexceptional  circumstances.  Any  case  made  for  carrying  out  any  operation \nwhich  requires  the  risk  to  be  in  the  intolerable  region,  however  briefly, \nneeds  to  be  made  very  rigorously  to  show  that  nothing  more  can \nreasonably  be  done.    Such  circumstances  should  be  regulated  consistent \nwith \nin  SAPs  paras  699-700.  Exceptional \ncircumstances  may  include,  for  instance,  situations  not  originally  foreseen \n\nthe  guidance  set  out \n\nReport : NS-TAST-GD-005 Revision 10 \nCM9 Ref: 2019/315236 \n\nPage 13 of 29 \n\n \n \n\n\fOffice for Nuclear Regulation  \n \n \n\n4. \n\n5. \n\n6. \n\nin  the  design  of  the  facility.  It  is  expected  that  the  licensee  will  put \narrangements in place to prevent a recurrence of the unforeseen situation. \n\nThe extent of the time for which the risk is increased should not be the sole \nargument  for  acceptability  that  a  situation  reduces  risks  to  ALARP.  The \nsafety  case  should,  drawing  from  appropriate  relevant  good  practice, \nconsider  whether  or  not  additional  measures  are  necessary.  As  in  any \nconsideration  of  ALARP,  the  magnitude  of  the  potential  consequences \nshould also be a factor, as well as the likelihood of the risk being realised. \n\nDuring  operations  which  impose  a  planned  short-term  risk,  additional \nmonitoring of the actual plant state should be undertaken to ensure that the \nmode  of  operation  and  the  time  during  which  it  persists  meet  the \nassumptions in the ALARP case. \n\nUnexpected failures of plant and equipment may lead to an increase in risk \nthat  is  so  high  that  BSLs  are  exceeded  and  the  risks  thus  judged \n\u201cintolerable\u201d (see TOR  [2]). In such cases the licensee should be actively \nmanaging and prioritising the situation to reduce the risks  back to ALARP \nas  quickly  as  possible.  It  certainly  should not  be  the  case  that  a  facility  is \nallowed  to  operate  at  this  level  of  risk  unless  there  is  no  alternative  (see \nparas 699-700 of the SAPs). \n\n \n\n  Residual Facility Life \u2013 Specific Considerations \n\n6.28  The SAPs (para 35) note that as a facility ages, its safety margins may be eroded, for \nexample due to the incidence of, or vulnerability to, faults increasing due to wear etc. \nReducing the risk level may not be possible, so a judgement then has to be made \nwhether the continued operation of the facility is acceptable at the higher risk. The \nfuture planned lifetime of the facility may be a factor in making such judgements. This \nsort of situation can be difficult where the ageing is gradual and there is no obvious \ntransition from 'safe' to 'not safe'. In such cases, careful monitoring and regular review, \nas required of licensees through compliance with their LC15 arrangements (particularly \nshort-term reviews \u2013 see T/AST/050 [23]), is likely to be needed. \n\n6.29  The guidance presented here relates to periods that are short in comparison to the \ntotal design or operational life of the facility. It also relates to assessment of safety \ncases either resulting from a Periodic Safety Review or at any time when a significant \nageing phenomenon is being considered.  \n\n6.30  The following points should be considered by inspectors in this context: \n\ni. \n\nThe  safety  case  should  be  updated  promptly  to  take  account  of  any \nrelevant  new  knowledge  or  experience  and  data  appropriate  to  the \ncurrent and predicted future state and mode of operation of the facility. \nComparison  with  modern  standards  of  engineering  and  operation  and \nrisk criteria should be undertaken. \n\nii.  The  revised  risk  assessment  must  show  that  the  facility  is  tolerable  for \nfuture  operations.  For  example  the  numerical  risk  estimates  should  not \nbe  greater  than  BSLs.  If  the  risk  is  deemed  to  be  intolerable  then  the \nguidance in SAPs paras 699-700 should be followed. \n\niii.  Proposed  limits  on  remaining  lifetime  may  be  invoked  in  making  the \nALARP  demonstration,  but  this  cannot  be  used  to  justify  a  facility \noperating in the intolerable region. A case not to make an improvement \nbased largely on limited future lifetime would only be acceptable where \nthe maximum extent of the future operational life is irrevocably fixed. In \ncases  where  the  planned  lifetime  is  not  irrevocably  fixed,  a  minimum \n\n \n \n\nReport : NS-TAST-GD-005 Revision 10 \nCM9 Ref: 2019/315236 \n\nPage 14 of 29 \n\n\fOffice for Nuclear Regulation  \n \n \n\nperiod  of  ten  years  (or  the  unavoidable  necessary  life  of  the  facility,  if \nlonger)  should  be  considered \nthe  ALARP \nfor \ndemonstration (see SAPs para 35). \n\nthe  purposes  of \n\n  End of Life Legacy \u2013 Specific Considerations \n\n6.31  There may be situations, particularly during cleanout and decommissioning, where the \nrisks need to be increased temporarily so that the long-term risks can then be reduced \nor eliminated (SAPs paras 759-767). Such increased risks need to be balanced against \nthe continuing risks from doing nothing and with due consideration of the alternatives \navailable to address the hazard. Cases arguing for extensive delays to hazard \nreduction by invoking CBA with significantly discounted future costs need to be \nguarded against. Concentration on removal of the hazard, or on decreasing its \npropensity to cause harm should instead be paramount. Arguments based simply on \ntime at risk will not generally be sufficient. \n\n6.32  During the course of hazard reduction, which may be for a significant time, it is \n\nexpected that suitable engineering and/or operational arrangements will be made to \nminimise, so far as is reasonably practicable, both the magnitude and time of the \nhigher risk, balancing e.g. operational doses and the potential for accidental releases.  \nFurther details on these aspects are addressed in T/AST/026 on Decommissioning). \n\n  Arguments for allowing an increase in risk \n\n6.33  Licensees may argue that moving to a less protected situation meets the ALARP \n\ncriteria e.g. by suggesting that increases in risk are more than balanced by the gains in \nreduced operational costs or increased operating profit. Other factors, particularly \nthose relating to good practice and previous experience, would militate against this \nargument and, in general, ONR would require previous good practice to be upheld.  \n\n6.34  To succeed in an approach where risks appear to increase, the licensee would have to \nshow \u201cchanged circumstances\u201d, as noted in para 39 of the HSE ALARP Principles [3], or \nthat the existing situation went well beyond what was required by ALARP. In addition, \nany case for reducing safety would also have to show that additional safety measures \nare not reasonably practicable in the new situation. However, where the level of risk is \nlow, and the increase in risk is small and forms part of a package which overall \nimproves health and safety, the licensee\u2019s proposals should be considered in this \nwider context.  \n\n6.35  Other grounds which may be acceptable are where the risks are low and the measures \nin place can be shown to be unduly conservative as a result of new knowledge. In \nother cases a change may be forced due to it being impossible to replace like-for-like \ncomponents due to obsolescence. Another possibility is where the safety case \ncontains generous margins which can be relaxed without any diminution in the \nrequired level of safety. Many people feel uncomfortable about accepting increased \nrisks, which is often referred to as \"reverse\" or \"negative\" ALARP, but in the past ONR \nhas accepted cases which meet the above criteria and HSE's ALARP principles (para \n39 of the HSE ALARP Principles) anticipate the need to deal with such situations. \n\n  Regulatory Application of ALARP and BAT/BPM \n\n6.36  Another area where an increase in risks (on and/or off-site) can occur is where \n\nadditional measures need to be taken on the site to reduce the quantity of radioactive \nmaterial permitted to be discharged to the environment in normal operations. This \nusually results from activities regulated by the Environment Agency and SEPA to \nreduce discharges to comply with Best Available Techniques (BAT) (or Best Practical \nMeans (BPM) in Scotland). Possible consequences of these additional measures are \nthat on-site accumulation of radioactive waste will increase (unless a disposal route \n\nReport : NS-TAST-GD-005 Revision 10 \nCM9 Ref: 2019/315236 \n\nPage 15 of 29 \n\n \n \n\n\fOffice for Nuclear Regulation  \n \n \n\nexists), or safety risks to workers will rise (e.g. from implementing and/or operating the \nnew measures).   \n\n6.37  Concerns were historically expressed by the nuclear industry that different regulatory \napplication of ALARP and BAT in nuclear safety and environmental protection gave a \npropensity for conflict. This was a factor that prompted a review of the working \nrelationship between HSE and EA in respect to nuclear sites and development of a \nStatement of Intent between HSE and EA in 2001. A separate Statement of Intent was \nalso developed for HSE interactions with SEPA.  \n\n6.38  Given the different terminology used in different legislation and the requirement for \n\nlicensees to meet all their duties, the term \u201coptimisation\u201d is used in T/AST/026 \n\u2018Decommissioning Technical Assessment Guide\u2019 to refer to the level of protection that \nmeets all the legal requirements of ALARP, BAT, BPM etc. Optimisation is also the \nterm used in the IAEA Safety Fundamentals [17] where Principle 5 states \u201cProtection \nmust be optimised to provide the highest level of safety that can reasonably be \nachieved.\u201d \n\n6.39  Consequently it is important that, during optioneering studies carried out by the \n\nlicensee to establish the BAT or BPM option, adequate weighting is given to health and \nsafety aspects so that an overall ALARP solution that balances health, safety and \nenvironmental aspects is reached in an optimised manner. Such a balance should \nconsider: \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\nThe  number  of  people  (workers  and  the  public)  who  may  be \nexposed to radiation; \n\nThe likelihood of their incurring exposures; \n\nThe magnitude and distribution of radiation doses received; \n\nRadiation risks arising from foreseeable events; \n\nEconomic, social and environmental factors. \n\nUsing good practices and common sense to avoid radiation risks as \nfar as is practical in day to day activities. \n\n6.40  More guidance on how to achieve ALARP in a decommissioning context is set out in \n\nT/AST/026. \n\n  Risk Trade-offs \n\n6.41 \n\nIf a change to the design or operation of a facility is implemented to reduce a particular \nrisk, it is highly likely that there will be other effects which could alter the risk profile of \nthe facility. Paras 36 to 38 of HSE's ALARP Principles [3] refers to this as Risk Transfer \nand confirm the importance of considering all of the risks within the licensee's control \nas part of a balanced decision on how to reduce overall risks to ALARP (see also para \n26(d)). It has already been emphasised that the full effect of the implementation needs \nto be considered in terms of the reduction in risks, but it should be borne in mind that \nrisks may also be increased in other areas. For example, risks from radiological \nhazards may be from accident or normal operational risks; these could affect the public \nand/or persons on-site; there may be conventional (non-radiological) risks arising from \nthe changes. It is important therefore, when considering implementation of a \nmodification, to consider whether the licensee has analysed all relevant types of risk \nand that any increase in risk in other areas is not greater than the decrease in the area \nbeing analysed.  \n\nReport : NS-TAST-GD-005 Revision 10 \nCM9 Ref: 2019/315236 \n\nPage 16 of 29 \n\n \n \n\n\fOffice for Nuclear Regulation  \n \n \n\n  Dose/Risk Sharing \n\n6.42 \n\n When considering doses that are received in normal operation, a certain degree of \ndose sharing is acceptable to reduce doses to individual workers and hence their risks. \nThe IRR ACoP [12] says that if a choice between restricting doses to individuals and \ngroups has to be made, priority should be given to keeping individual doses as far \nbelow dose limits as reasonably practicable. Dose sharing might reduce individual \ndoses further but should not be used as a primary means of complying with dose \nlimits. Priority should instead be given to changing methods of work, improving \nengineering controls and adopting other means of restricting exposure. In the case of \ndoses received due to accidental releases, the concept of risk sharing for workers by \nuse of occupancy factors may be questionable; individual risk cannot be made \nacceptable by using many people for short periods so each only gets a small portion of \nthe total risk.  \n\n  Occupancy Factors \n\n6.43 \n\nIn the analysis of an individual fault scenario, the risks and protection measures should \nbe assessed with respect to the potential dose to a worker who is exposed to the \nconsequences of identified faults/events. The likelihood of a particular fault/event \nshould not be judged acceptable on one facility, and not on another, merely because \nthere are more people working within the first facility to \"share\" the risk. When \nsumming risks to an individual worker on a facility from all faults (e.g. for comparison \nagainst SAPs Target 5), it is acceptable to consider justified \"occupancy\" factors as not \nall persons on-site will be exposed to all the risks from the facility.   \n\n6.44  Occupancy claims need to be considered carefully as the occupancy under \n\nconsideration can mean different things: \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\nthe  fraction  of  time  a  specific  individual  is  on-site.  If  the  risk  being \nestimated is to a specific individual this factor is valid. \n\nthe  fraction  of  risks  on  a  particular  facility  or  site  that  a  specific \nindividual may be exposed to. Again if calculating specific individual risk \nis the aim, including this factor is valid. \n\nthe likelihood of a worker being in the vicinity of an accident. Where a \nworker  may  be  present  for  part  of  the  time  and  the  fault  is  random, \nthere  are  two  situations  to  consider:  in  assessing  the  risk  in  cases \nwhere the occupancy is controlled it is valid to consider the occupancy \nfactor, but  where the occupancy is uncontrolled (e.g. in a  corridor) the \ndose should be assessed assuming a person is present. \n\n In considering SAPs Target 6, which addresses doses from single accidents on site, it \nis expected that estimates will be made assuming someone is present unless \nadequate control measures are in force to ensure their absence (see SAPs Annex 2). \nShould the summed risk to any worker be high however, then justified occupancy \nclaims can be considered, along with any proposals to control exposure etc. \n\n6.45 \n\n \n\nLong-Term Risk Assessment \n\n6.46  There is a growing perception that risks that are imposed, that are unevenly \n\ndistributed, or that affect future generations should be scrutinised and seen to be \njustified (R2P2\nparticularly those associated with radioactive waste management and \ndecommissioning, run over many years, and the risks that result may affect future \ngenerations of workers and the public as well as the present generation. For such \n\n, paras 47 & 48). Some projects in the nuclear industry, and \n\nReport : NS-TAST-GD-005 Revision 10 \nCM9 Ref: 2019/315236 \n\nPage 17 of 29 \n\n \n \n\n\fOffice for Nuclear Regulation  \n \n \n\ncases the risks should be assessed in a holistic manner and not restricted to part of \nthe overall time period or part of a process.  \n\n6.47 \n\nIn general, we should seek to protect future generations at least as well as we seek to \nprotect the present one. Although it could be argued that the next few generations may \ngain some indirect benefit, the uncertainty of how they will view the risks left to them \n(and indeed the uncertainty of any benefits further into the future) argues for a \nprecautionary approach  (R2P2\ndemonstration that risks are indeed ALARP. We would therefore expect to see \nparticular efforts made to demonstrate that risks to future generations are at least \nconsistent with the levels of risk that would be accepted as adequate protection for the \npresent generation.  \n\n, paras 89-93) and hence a particularly stringent \n\n6.48  Given the uncertainties in estimating long-term future risks, good practice and the \n\napplication of the Engineering Key Principles hierarchy with the emphasis on control of \nhazard (see SAPs EKP 1-4) are likely to be much more important than numerical risk \nestimates and CBA in establishing the way forward. In this context it is worth bearing in \nmind that a 1x10 -4/ yr risk for one year implies a low likelihood of someone being hurt, \nwhereas 1x10 -4/ yr for 10000 years implies a high likelihood of an adverse \nconsequence. \n\n  SFAIRP and the Requirement for Risk Assessment \n\n6.49  The requirement to carry out a risk assessment and produce a safety case is absolute \n\nand cannot be argued against on the grounds that the costs are grossly \ndisproportionate to the risks (see para 26c). Instead, the scope, depth and effort put \ninto the risk assessment / safety case should be proportionate to the level of risk and \nhazard. \n\n7. \n\nALARP AND REGULATORY DECISIONS \n\n7.1 \n\nLicensees may need to conduct their undertakings in a given way in order to secure \ncertain societal or public interest benefits such as activities in \u201cthe interests of national \nsecurity\u201d or \u201ckeeping the lights on\u201d, or because \u201cthe priorities for a fixed national \n(government) budget lie elsewhere\u201d.  Claims related to such \u201cStrategic Imperatives\u201d \ncan sometimes appear in safety cases in the context of \u201ctime\u201d, or \u201ctrouble\u201d aspects, on \nthe sacrifice side of the ALARP balance.  Inspectors should however, make their \njudgements on whether the legal duty to reduce risks to ALARP has been met \nindependently of such considerations, as these normally lie beyond the scope of \nHSWA.  Instead these Strategic Imperatives will normally be a factor informing ONR\u2019s \nenforcement decisions.  For instance, if risks have not been reduced to ALARP, \nrelevant Strategic Imperatives can and should be taken into account by those with \ndelegated authority when determining proportionate enforcement action, or in \ndecisions whether to grant a permission. Guidance on what to do when dealing with \nStrategic Imperatives is provided in the following two sections.  \n\nEnforcement Decisions \n\n7.2 \n\nEnforcement decisions within ONR are made in accordance with the ONR\u2019s \nEnforcement Policy Statement [22], which sets out the principles, purpose and methods \nof enforcement.  A spectrum of enforcement options is available depending on the \ncircumstances.  These range from providing verbal or written advice, delaying or \nrefusing to grant a permission for a given activity, issuing Improvement or Prohibition \nNotices, through to prosecution in the most serious cases.  Reflecting this, HSE has \ndeveloped the Enforcement Management Model (EMM) to guide regulators in making \nconsistent and proportionate enforcement decisions.   \n\nReport : NS-TAST-GD-005 Revision 10 \nCM9 Ref: 2019/315236 \n\nPage 18 of 29 \n\n \n \n\n\fOffice for Nuclear Regulation  \n \n \n\n7.3 \n\nONR guidance on applying the EPS within the framework of the Nuclear Licencing \nregime is provided in \u201cThe Enforcement Management Model in ONR\u201d, NS-ENF-GD-002  \n[19].  In applying the EMM to ALARP decisions, inspectors should establish the \nseriousness of shortfalls with reference to the risk gap (i.e. between where the licensee \nis and where they ought to be when complying with the law).  This should then be used \nto inform ONR\u2019s decision on appropriate enforcement action.  It is at this point in the \nEMM process that Duty holder and Strategic Factors should be taken in to account, \nand not when determining legal compliance.  \n\nPermissioning Decisions \n\nSimilarly, where the licensee\u2019s ALARP justification is part of a request to grant a \npermission required under a nuclear site Licence Condition, ONR inspectors should \ndistinguish between wider arguments related to Duty holder and Strategic Factors and \nthe judgement as to whether risks are reduced to ALARP.  Ultimately, consideration of \nan ALARP shortfall in the context of these wider factors may lead ONR to nonetheless \ngrant permission for the activity, e.g. where it is deemed in the public interest to do so.  \nThe supporting audit trail (i.e. the Project Assessment Report, PAR) for such Licence \nInstruments should clearly define the rationale for the decisions made, and detail why \nthe permission has been granted, despite the evident shortfall(s) in demonstrating \nALARP. \n\n It must also be recognised that, in accordance with ONR\u2019s regulatory philosophy and \nirrespective of any claims of Strategic  Factors, there may be situations where the \nlicensee has not adequately demonstrated that risks have been reduced to ALARP, \nbut where the gap is such that it would be disproportionate not to grant a permission.  \nIn these cases, inspectors should work with the licensee to bring the situation back into \nlegal compliance, but this process should not (depending on the EMM) necessarily \nmean that our permission is withheld. \n\nONR\u2019s published guide to risk informed regulatory decision making [28] gives further \ninformation on the factors involved in decision making and notes that \u201cThere can also \nbe other wider factors (beyond dutyholder and strategic factors), such as \u2018in the \ninterests of national security\u2019, that we term strategic imperatives, where we do not have \nthe authority or sufficient knowledge of the considerations involved to judge the \nsignificance of such factors. Strategic imperatives would not normally change our \nregulatory decision, but may require a different course of action. In such \ncircumstances, we would work collaboratively with the dutyholder to ensure the best \nsafety outcome within the constraints of the imperative, but also to ensure that all \nrelevant stakeholders understand the implication of the chosen course of action. Such \ncircumstances have been, and are likely to remain, extremely rare.\u201d  \n\n \n\n8. \n\nCHECKLIST \n\nAttached at Annex 1 is a checklist of the main assessment points which will help \ninspectors decide whether all the key points have been addressed by the licensee in \nits ALARP assessment. \n\n \n\n7.4 \n\n7.5 \n\n7.6 \n\n8.1 \n\n \n\nReport : NS-TAST-GD-005 Revision 10 \nCM9 Ref: 2019/315236 \n\nPage 19 of 29 \n\n \n \n\n\fOffice for Nuclear Regulation  \n \n \n\n9. \n\nREFERENCES \n\n1.

If the engineering and operation of the facility gives \nno  cause  for  concern,  and  the  risks  are  adequately  demonstrated  to  be  \"broadly \nacceptable\"  (i.e.  below  all  the  BSOs)  then  this  is  sufficient  for  ONR  assessment \npurposes.  If  the  risks  are  above  a  BSO,  then  inspectors  should  consider  specifically \nwhether these are reduced to ALARP. \n\nA1.2  If the risks exceed a BSL or fall significantly short of an accepted relevant good \npractice,  e.g.  evidently  poor  engineering  or  sub-standard  operations  (procedures  or \nimplementation) then inspectors need to follow the advice set out in SAPs paras 699-\n700.  This  includes  consideration  of  whether  the  facility  should  be  shutdown  or  the \nactivity curtailed. \n\nA1.3  The following checkpoints may be relevant in reviewing licensees' safety cases \nor arguments that the risks are ALARP: \n\n1.  Is there evidence of an adequate and fit-for-purpose evaluation of risks that underpins \n\n2.  Does the ALARP argument refer only to those risks which the licensee controls (para \n\nthe ALARP case (para 5.3) \n\n5.4(1)) \n\n3.  Affordability is not a legitimate factor in the assessment of costs (para 5.4(2)) \n\n4.  ALARP cannot be used to argue against statutory duties (para 5.4(3)) \n\n5.  Does  the  ALARP  argument  take  adequate  account  of  all  types  of  risks,  including \n\nconventional (i.e. non-radiological) risks (para 5.4(4)) \n\n6.  Have  all  relevant  options  been  considered  by  the  licensee  and  does  the  licensee's \nstudy  of  the  options  begin  with  the  safest  (as  opposed  to  the  cheapest)  option  para \n5.4(5)) \n\n7.  If measures are deemed not reasonably practicable, has partial implementation been \nconsidered? Inspectors need also to be wary of \"deluxe\" measures unduly inflating the \ncost para 5.4(5)) \n\n8.  Is the rigour of ALARP case made commensurate with the level of risk in the scenario \n\n9.  For  measures  deemed  not  reasonably  practicable,  has  the  licensee  demonstrated \n\nunder consideration (para 5.4(7)) \n\ngross disproportion (para 5.4(8)) \n\n10. The  ALARP  arguments  should  include  explicit  consideration  of  qualitative  features \nrelated to engineering and other types of relevant good practice (para 6.1 \u2013 6.49). \n\n11. The  ALARP  argument  should  be  based  on  comparisons  with  relevant  good  practice, \ninformed as necessary by CBA (para 6.13), rather than the other way around. A CBA \non its own is not acceptable as an ALARP case.  \n\n12. Are  all  of  the  relevant  engineering  SAPs  met?  If  not,  has  the  licensee  identified  and \n\nconsidered any deficiencies from an ALARP perspective (para 6.8) \n\n13. ALARP applies at all times and arguments employing Time at Risk may need special \n\nconsideration (para 6.24 \u2013 6.31). \n\n14. Reverse  ALARP  arguments  for  increased  risk  are  only  allowable  in  \u2018changed \ncircumstances\u2019  or  where  the  licensee  can  show  that  the  existing  situation  goes  well \nbeyond what is required by ALARP (para 6.35).  \n\nReport : NS-TAST-GD-005 Revision 10 \nCM9 Ref: 2019/315236 \n\nPage 22 of 29 \n\n \n \n\n\fOffice for Nuclear Regulation  \n \n \n\n15.

In contrast to the majority of cases we normally \ndeal  with  at  existing  licensed  sites,  the  ALARP  arguments  presented  for  GDA  will  not \nrelate to whether additional features should be implemented to an existing design, but will \ninstead involve consideration of the facility\u2019s design as a whole.  Thus the position when a \nnew reactor design is presented to us goes beyond the situations considered in other HSE \nALARP guidance.   \n\nA2.2  Although nominally at the design stage, all of the proposed designs are essentially \ncomplete in terms of the overall concept and major systems, and have reached that stage \nafter  many  years  of  development  and  optimisation  in  non-UK  regulatory  environments. \nHowever,  the  essence  of  the  UK  system  is  goal-setting  and  the  main  objective  is  to  see \nwhether  the  reactor  designs  represent  an  ALARP  outcome  rather  than  to  examine  the \nroute  by  which  that  end  was  achieved.  Similarly,  ONR  needs  to  look  at  the  design \nholistically and be guided by overall safety rather than focussing on incremental changes \n(e.g.  the  thickness  of  a  concrete  wall,  or  level  of  redundancy  in  a  single  system)  to \nindividual elements of the safety argument in isolation. Hence the intention is not to seek \nnew, UK-specific design features, but to see that the law is met. Furthermore we recognise \nthere  are  safety  benefits  in  standardisation:  a  wider  pool  of  experience  will  inevitably \nprovide  better  feedback  for  future  improvement  in  safety  and  this  must  be  taken  into \naccount.  It  is  also  worth  noting  that  the  intent  is  to  judge  whether  the  individual  designs \nmeet the requirement to demonstrate ALARP on their own merits, not to compare them.  \n\nA2.3  For the overall ALARP demonstrations we expect the four main areas below to be \naddressed: \n\n1    There  is  a  clear  conclusion  that  there  are  no  further  reasonable  practicable \nimprovements that could be implemented, and therefore the risk has been reduced to \nALARP. \n\n2    Relevant  Good  Practice:  This  is  the  basic  requirement  for  demonstrating  that \ndesigns  meet  the  law.  The  Requesting  Party  (RP)  must  set  out  the  standards  and \ncodes  used  and  justify  them  to  the  extent  that  we  can  \u2018deem\u2019  them  relevant  good \npractice  when  viewed  against  our  SAPs.  This  justification  is  expected  to  include  a \ncomparison  with  other  international/  national  standards.  Clearly  the  standards  and \ncodes adopted by the RP must be shown to have been met. \n\n3  Options: This will comprise two stages: Firstly an examination of the RP\u2019s rationale \nfor  the  evolution  of  the  design,  using  its  forerunners  as  a  baseline,  looking  at  why \ncertain features were selected and others rejected and how this process has resulted \nin an improved design from a safety perspective.  Secondly the RP needs to address \nthe question \u201cwhat more could be done?\u201d and provide an argument of \u201cwhy they can\u2019t \ndo it\u201d (i.e. why it is not reasonably practicable).  This second element could be done by \npostulating  further  options  for  improvement  (previously  discarded  options  may  be \nsuitable  candidates)  and  evaluating  them.  Clearly  if  an  option  is  shown  to  be \nreasonably  practicable  then  that  option  should  have  been  taken,  or  where  it  is  found \nnot  to  be  excessively  expensive  to  improve  safety,  then  further  avenues  for  risk \nreduction should be explored.  \n\n4  Risk Assessment: The use of risk targets in isolation is not an acceptable means of \ndemonstrating  ALARP  and  we  expect  to  see  risk  assessments  used  to  identify \npotential engineering and/or operational improvements as well as confirming numerical \nlevels  of  safety.  The  BSOs  in  the  SAPs  represent  broadly  acceptable  levels  below \nwhich we have said that we expect to confine ourselves to considering the validity of \nthe arguments that the BSOs have actually been met. We have also made it clear that \n\nReport : NS-TAST-GD-005 Revision 10 \nCM9 Ref: 2019/315236 \n\nPage 24 of 29 \n\n \n \n\n\fOffice for Nuclear Regulation  \n \n \n\nthe way in which we apply these numerical targets will depend heavily on the views we \nform on the engineering (and at a later stage operational practices) and that meeting \nthe  BSOs  is  not  a  green  light  for  RPs  to  forego  further  ALARP  considerations. \nNevertheless, well-supported numerical risk figures that show BSOs to be met can be \nan important element of support to the overall ALARP demonstration \n\nA2.4    In  support  of  these  four  elements,  ONR  expects  the  following  in  respect  of  new \ncommercial reactor designs: \n\n\uf0b7  The level of safety must be no less than a comparable facility already working or being \n\nconstructed in the UK or somewhere else in the world. \n\n\uf0b7  As  evolutionary  designs,  which  have  been  designed  taking  account  of  experience  of \nearlier  ones,  the  RP  must  show  how  the  evolution  has  maintained  or  improved  the \ndesign from a safety perspective. \n\n\uf0b7  The  demonstration  should  set  out  how  known  problem  areas  (e.g.  identified  from \nOperational Experience Feedback (OEF), improved analysis, or improving standards) \nhave been addressed and how and why the particular solution chosen was arrived at. \n\n\uf0b7  The  Engineering  Key  Principles  (EKP)  1,  2  and  3  of  SAPs  should  be  seen  as  a \nhierarchy  where,  all  else  being  equal,  the  higher  up  the  list  the  better.  Cases  where \nthis is not so will need specific justification. \n\n\uf0b7  Likewise, the hierarchy within EKP 5 should be addressed in a similar manner. \n\n\uf0b7  There  should  be  clarity  to  the  reasons  for  the  choice  of  design  standards  and \ndemonstration that the chosen ones lead to the safest reasonably practicable design. \n\n\uf0b7  The RP must provide evidence that it has used processes for making design decisions \nin which safety is clearly considered and has been given the appropriate priority. \n\n\uf0b7  Risk/CBA  type  arguments  on  their  own  must  not  be  allowed  to  override  established \n\nrelevant good practice where this results in degradation in safety. \n\nA2.5  In addition we might reasonably expect the RP to provide evidence of the following: \n\n\uf0b7  The RP should show how its process is compatible with UK law; specifically how \nthe  comparison  of  sacrifice  and  risk  averted  is  considered  within  the  design \nprocess and what approach is used for determining \u201cgross disproportion\u201d; \n\n\uf0b7  Where risk-based CBA-type decision-making has been used, the costings should \nbe  appropriate  to  UK  conditions,  gross  disproportion  factors  justified  and \nadequate  sensitivity  studies  should  be  included  to  demonstrate  a  robust \nconclusion; \n\n\uf0b7  The  design  should  be  considered  holistically  so  that  whilst  individual  systems \ncould be improved, the impact on the overall risks makes further improvement not \nreasonably practicable; \n\n\uf0b7  There is a proper balancing of all risks, worker/public, normal operation/accident, \nradiological/conventional and the procedures used to ensure this should be clear \nand adequate; \n\n\uf0b7 \n\n\uf0b7 \n\nIf any numerical targets for risks are used as cut-offs these must be justified either \nas a whole or in individual applications; \n\nIn particular, where intermediate targets rather than the effects on people and the \nenvironment are used, the RP should: (a) explain why such a target is used; (b) \nexplain  how  it  is  used  during  design  and  optioneering;  (c)  justify  the  specific \ntarget; and (d) justify the levels of \u201cgross disproportion\u201d used. \n\n \n\n \n\nReport : NS-TAST-GD-005 Revision 10 \nCM9 Ref: 2019/315236 \n\n \n \n\nPage 25 of 29 \n\n\fOffice for Nuclear Regulation  \n \n \n\nAnnex 3 \n\nRGP Common questions and answers \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nRemind me! \u2013 What is ALARP? \n\nA3.1  ALARP stands for \u201cas low as reasonably practicable\u201d and is used when referring to the \nsteps necessary to reduce health and safety risks in order to meet legal duties.  It is the term \nused by ONR, HSE and industry.  For almost all purposes it has the same meaning as \u201cso far \nas is reasonably practicable\u201d (SFAIRP) as used in health and safety legislation.   \n\nA3.2  A  risk  has  been  reduced  ALARP  when  a  dutyholder  can  show  that  further  risk \nreduction  is  not  justified  because  the  sacrifice  associated  with  doing  so  would  be  grossly \ndisproportionate in terms of money, time or trouble.  Sections 2 and 3 of the Health and Safety \nat Work etc. Act 1974 require dutyholders to reduce the risks to their employees and to others \nfrom  their  activities  SFAIRP.    Similar  requirements  are  also  reinforced  in  more  specific \napplications  through  other  health  and  safety  legislation,  such  as  the  Ionising  Radiations \nRegulations 2017. \n\nA3.3  SFAIRP,  and  by  implication  ALARP,  are  \u2018goal-setting\u2019  standards  that  provide  an \nobjective against which a dutyholder must select and then justify its approach to achieving it. \n\nWho judges ALARP? \n\nA3.4  Ultimately,  whether  a  dutyholder  has  complied  with  its  legal  duty  to  reduce  risks \nALARP in a particular case may be for a court of law or employment tribunal to decide.   \n\nA3.5  However,  in  regulating  the  industry,  ONR  (and  other  regulators)  effectively  make  the \nrequired day-to-day judgements, e.g. as part of inspecting and assessing dutyholders against \ntheir  obligations  and  in  deciding  whether  to  take  enforcement  action.    We  use  a  body  of \nknowledgeable  and  experienced  inspectors,  assisted  by  comprehensive  guidance,  to  make \nthese judgements on the basis of the available evidence.  ONR also considers ALARP during \nthe  assessment  of  a  licensee\u2019s  safety  case  carried  out  as  part  of  making  a  permissioning \ndecision.   \n\nA3.6  Note  that  our  regulatory  decisions  (including  those  relating  to  enforcement  action  or \nthe granting of permission) also take into account broader factors in addition to whether or not \nlegal standards, including that of ALARP, have been achieved.  This is described in our Risk \nInformed Regulatory Decision Making guidance. \n\nWhat is good practice? \n\n\u2018Good  practice\u2019  is  a  generic  term  referring  to  a  wide  range  of  control  measures, \n\nA3.7 \npolicies, practices and other aspects pertaining to a particular health and safety issue. \n\nA3.8  Good  practice  can  refer  to  physical  aspects,  including  the  design  of  plant  and \nequipment, the fitting of safety mechanisms, mitigating and emergency measures or to the use \nof  particular  items  of  personal  protective  equipment.    It  can  equally  refer  to  administrative \ncontrol  measures,  including  things  like  training  practices,  maintenance,  inspection,  testing, \ndecision-making processes or operating instructions.  It can also refer to fault, hazard or risk \nanalysis  methodologies,  strategies,  design  principles,  risk  targets  and  other  approaches  to \nsafety analysis, substantiation or design.   \n\nWhat are the sources of good practice? \n\nA3.9  While anyone can propose good practice, there is a hierarchy to its significance based \non its formal status and pedigree, i.e. the weight it might carry in a potential court case:  \n\n\uf06e \n\nApproved Codes of Practice (ACoPs) carry the strongest weight and have a \nspecial legal status.  If a dutyholder complies with the approach to a health and \n\nReport : NS-TAST-GD-005 Revision 10 \nCM9 Ref: 2019/315236 \n\nPage 26 of 29 \n\n \n \n\n\fOffice for Nuclear Regulation  \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\nsafety issue set-out in an ACoP, then it is deemed to have complied with the \nlaw.  A dutyholder may choose to follow a different approach, but then must be \nable to demonstrate why this is equivalent or it will be considered to be below \nminimum legal compliance.  (Note that an ACoP is usually published as a \nsingle document to go with a set of regulations.  This will provide the ACoP text \ntogether with accompanying non-statutory guidance.  The accompanying \nguidance does not however carry the special legal status of the ACoP.) \n \nPublished regulatory guidance is also a recognised source of good practice.  \nFor nuclear and conventional safety, our principal sources of good practice are \nthe Safety Assessment Principles (SAPs) and the additional guidance provided \nin the Technical Assessment Guides (TAGs) and Technical Inspection Guides \n(TIGs).   \n\nOther written sources which may be recognised as good practice include \nguidance produced by:  \n\n\uf0b7 \n\uf0b7 \n\n\uf0b7 \n\nother government departments; \nnational and international standard-setting bodies, e.g. the British \nStandards Institute (BSI), International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), \nInternational Standards Organisation (ISO), the European Committee \nfor Standardisation (CEN) or Western European Nuclear Regulators\u2019 \nAssociation (WENRA); \nindustry bodies and professional institutes, e.g. the Safety Directors\u2019 \nForum (SDF), Nuclear Engineering Directors\u2019 Forum (NEDF) or World \nAssociation of Nuclear Operators (WANO). \n\n\uf06e \n\nThere may be unwritten sources of good practice, for example through well-\ndefined and well-established practices across a particular industrial sector.   \n\nA3.10  The mixing of different standards \u2013 \u2018pick and mix\u2019 \u2013 is discouraged where there is an \nregulatory \napplicable  encompassing  standard,  particularly \nexpectations  or  those  from  authoritative  national  and  international  bodies,  such  as  British \nStandards or IAEA Safety Standards.  However, a case can be made in some circumstances \nto draw upon standards from different sources if the situation warrants it.  The important thing \nis  to  consider  the  overall  outcome  against  the  ALARP  requirement.    It  is  also  important  to \nensure  that  we  do  not  apply  inappropriate  regulatory  pressure  to  \u2018gold-plate\u2019  the  solution \nbeyond what would be ALARP.  \n\nfor  standards  set-out \n\nin \n\nWhat is RGP? \n\nA3.11  RGP stands for \u2018Relevant Good Practice\u2019.  It refers to the body of good practice that is \nspecifically  relevant  to  the  situation  and  that  which,  if  implemented,  would  typically  be \nconsidered to meet the requirement to reduce risks to as ALARP for a particular situation. \n\nA3.12  The concept of RGP is used because there is usually well-established good practice in \naddressing  a  particular  issue  and  it  is  usually  unnecessary  for  a  dutyholder  to  revert  to  a \ndetailed,  first-principles  ALARP  demonstration  in  most  circumstances.    RGP  is  therefore \nhelpful in avoiding unnecessary replicated effort where the standard that would be required by \nthe courts and the regulator is well-recognised.  This is often true in areas that are common \nacross  industry,  including  many  aspects  of  conventional  health  and  safety  and  the  more \nwidespread aspects of nuclear and radiological safety.  \n\nA3.13  The  concept  of  RGP  is  less  helpful  for  unique  or  unusual  circumstances  because \ntypical  standards  and  practices  are  often  not  fully  relevant  to  the  situation.    In  these  cases \nRGP  is  only  a  starting  point  for  a  more  detailed  demonstration  against  the  fundamental \nALARP  requirement.    This  is  often  true  for  older  nuclear  facilities  which  fall  short  of  modern \n\nReport : NS-TAST-GD-005 Revision 10 \nCM9 Ref: 2019/315236 \n\nPage 27 of 29 \n\n \n \n\n\fOffice for Nuclear Regulation  \n \n \n\nstandards  developed  since  they  were  constructed.    This  can  be  exacerbated  by  age-related \ndegradation,  making  decommissioning  more  challenging.    Whilst  what  is  RGP  elsewhere \nshould still be used as a starting point, the dutyholder may be able to demonstrate an ALARP \napproach that does not meet all aspects of the usual standard in the specific circumstances. \n\nA3.14  Remember:  for  something  to  be  RGP  it  must  be  \u2018relevant\u2019  in  that  it  has  been  read-\nacross  for  appropriately  similar  circumstances.    It  must  also  represent  \u2018good  practice\u2019  rather \nthan \u2018best practice\u2019 (a practice beyond what the law requires). \n\nA3.15  Note that ONR also uses the concept of RGP to underpin its judgment of compliance \nagainst  other  goal-setting  requirements  in  addition  to  those  based  on  ALARP/SFAIRP,  such \nas \u201csuitable and sufficient\u201d and \u201cadequate\u201d as used in the licence conditions.  The remaining \nquestions and answers in this document are generally also applicable to these kinds of goal-\nsetting requirements as well as ALARP. \n\nWhat is the legal basis of RGP? \n\nA3.16  RGP  does  not  have  a  legal  basis  and  is  not  mentioned  in  legislation,  although  a \nregulator\u2019s view on what is considered to be RGP is likely to be persuasive in a court of law. \n\nA3.17  RGP  is  based  on  regulatory  policy  and  refers  to  the  controls,  standards  and \napproaches  that  meet  the  ALARP  requirement  based  on  what  has  been  accepted  in  similar \ncircumstances.    It  is  used  to  avoid  the  need  for  first-principles  ALARP  justifications  being \nrequired  for  commonly  encountered  circumstances  or  to  provide  a  starting  point  for \ndetermining the ALARP position in more complex or bespoke situations.  Adherence to RGP is \nnot a legal requirement: alternative approaches can be used.  \n\nWho determines RGP? \n\nA3.18  As part of demonstrating ALARP, a dutyholder will need to consider and judge what it \nconsiders to be RGP in order to be able to make an argument for the reasonable practicability \nof  the  approach  it  has  taken.    The  arguments  and  evidence  supporting  ALARP  justifications \nshould be included within the safety case. \n\nA3.19  The  regulator  also  needs  to  consider  and  judge  RGP,  based  on  the  sources  listed \nabove, to enable regulatory judgments.  In doing so, it is important to bear in mind that RGP is \nonly regulatory policy, and represents only an interpretation of what is considered to meet the \nlegal requirement based on similar circumstances (although a regulator\u2019s view on what is RGP \nwill be persuasive in a court of law). \n\nAre alternatives to RGP acceptable? \n\nA3.20  Definitely!    RGP  is  not  the  law:  it  is  a  regulatory  concept  that  provides  a  practical \nmechanism for day-to-day judgments on what would usually be considered to meet the legal \nrequirements based on what has been judged and accepted in similar circumstances.  If the \nsame  standards  of  safety  can  be  achieved  through  different  means  then  this  also  complies \nwith the law.  \n\nCan standards lower than RGP be acceptable? \n\nA3.21  Yes they can \u2013 because it is the overall outcome that matters and lower standards in \nsome areas might be justifiable providing the overall result can be shown in the safety case to \nbe  ALARP.    However,  it  can  be  challenging  to  argue  for  lower  standards  because  the  RGP \n(providing that it is relevant and constitutes \u2018good\u2019 practice) embodies the approach that has \nbeen previously judged to meet the legal standard in similar circumstances.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nReport : NS-TAST-GD-005 Revision 10 \nCM9 Ref: 2019/315236 \n\nPage 28 of 29 \n\n \n \n\n\fOffice for Nuclear Regulation  \n \n \n\nWhat are the key things I should consider when making regulatory ALARP judgments? \nA3.22  If  you  are  making  an  assessment  of  an  ALARP  position  you  should  consider  the \nfollowing: \n\nRemember that the requirement is to reduce risks to be ALARP and this refers \nto the overall outcome rather than seeking to narrowly apply ALARP to each \nindividual aspect.   \n \nRGP refers to those good practices (be they safety measures, standards, etc.) \nthat have been assessed and judged to meet the legal standard in similar \ncircumstances and are applicable to the situation at hand.  Only those good \npractices that are both relevant and \u2018good\u2019 (as opposed to \u2018best practice\u2019 or \ninadequate practice) are RGP:  you must think carefully whether these are \nrelevant to the situation and provide good practice (as opposed to inadequate \npractice or best practice).  \n \nALARP in relation to older facilities and in decommissioning requires especially \ncareful consideration.  RGP on modern design and operational standards is \noften not fully relevant and it is particularly important to consider the overall \noutcome, including the long-term safety benefits. \n \nRemember that RGP is not mandatory.  It is most applicable to commonly-\nencountered circumstances but is only a starting point in situations that do not \nfall within the scope of the circumstances under which the RGP has been \nbased.  A dutyholder is free to take an alternative approach providing it can \ndemonstrate that it has achieved an ALARP position. \n \nIt is important to understand how and why a dutyholder considers its position to \nbe ALARP.  You must avoid making premature judgments until you have seen \na dutyholder\u2019s ALARP case, even when you are confident in the authority of the \nRGP you have identified. \n \nIt is important to properly document the sources of any RGP which we have \nidentified and to properly record your reasoning, judgement and the application \nof our decision-making due process. \n \nIt is important to ensure appropriate cross-discipline working within ONR to \nensure we make balanced and proportionate judgements. You should seek \nappropriate specialist advice, including the appropriate engineering or human \nfactors expectations and fault analysis.  \n \nIt is important that you make use of the ONR ALARP TAG and the HSE \u20186-\npack\u2019 guidance as appropriate, seeking assistance where necessary \u2013 such as \nfrom the ONR ALARP Working Group. \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n \n\nReport : NS-TAST-GD-005 Revision 10 \nCM9 Ref: 2019/315236 \n\nPage 29 of 29 \n\n \n \n\n\f", "Management of Radioactive material ns-tast-gd-024.pdf\n Title of document \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nONR GUIDE \n\nMANAGEMENT OF RADIOACTIVE MATERIAL AND RADIOACTIVE WASTE ON \nNUCLEAR LICENSED SITES \n\nDocument Type: \n\nNuclear Safety Technical Assessment Guide \n\nUnique Document ID and \nRevision No: \n\nNS-TAST-GD-24 Revision 6 \n\nDate Issued: \n\nSeptember 2019 \n\nReview Date: \n\nSeptember 2022 \n\nApproved by: \n\nNicholas Blackburn  Professional Lead \n\nRecord Reference: \n\n2019/254780 \n\nRevision commentary: \n\nRevision 6 \n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS \n\nINTRODUCTION ............................................................................................................... 2 \n\n2.

The principles presented \nin the SAPs are supported by a suite of Technical Assessment Guide (TAG) [2] to \nguide regulatory decision making.  The outcome of an assessment by ONR is to reach \nan independent and informed judgement on the adequacy of a nuclear safety case [3].  \nThis TAG contains guidance to advise and inform ONR inspectors and assessors in \nthe exercise of their regulatory judgment. \n\n2. \n\nPURPOSE AND SCOPE \n\nThis TAG contains general guidance, to advise and inform ONR inspectors in \nexercising their professional regulatory judgements on the management of nuclear \nmatter on nuclear licensed sites.  This TAG has also been written with due cognisance \nof relevant International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) safety standards for the \nmanagement of radioactive waste [4].  This TAG is also intended to demonstrate how \nONR meets the Western European Nuclear Regulators\u2019 Association (WENRA) Safety \nReference Levels (SRL) for waste and spent nuclear fuel storage [5] and for treatment \nand conditioning of radioactive waste [6]. \n\nThe TAG is written as guidance for ONR inspectors to carry out their regulatory duties, \nit is not written for duty holders and although it may be used by duty holders as a \nsource of guidance or good practice, it should not be interpreted by duty holders as a \nset of prescriptive legal requirements. \n\nThis guidance relates to the management of radioactive material and radioactive \nwaste, which is currently being, or may be accumulated or stored on nuclear licensed \nsites, which have met ONR\u2019s criteria relating to bulk quantities for licensing [7].  In this \nguidance, the meaning of these terms is as defined in ONR\u2019s Licence Condition \nHandbook [8].  Some radioactive material and radioactive waste is also nuclear matter, \nas defined in section 26(1) of the Nuclear Installations Act (NIA65) [9]: \n\n\u201cnuclear matter\u201d means, subject to any exceptions which may be prescribed- \n\na)  any fissile material in the form of uranium metal, alloy or chemical compound \n\n(including natural uranium), or of plutonium metal, alloy or chemical compound, \nand any other fissile material which may be prescribed; and \n\nb)  any radioactive material produced in, or made radioactive by exposure to the \nradiation incidental to, the process of producing or utilising any such fissile \nmaterial as aforesaid. \n\n2.4 \n\nRadioactive material and radioactive waste may be generated as a result of activities \nassociated with the nuclear fuel cycle, nuclear medicine, licensed defence sites, \nresearch or as a result of decommissioning.  Radioactive material includes materials in \nstore prior to use (e.g. new reactor fuel and radioisostopes), and also certain fissile \nand other radioactive materials that may be declared as radioactive waste in the future.  \nThese materials will require safe long-term management in a similar manner as for \nradioactive waste. \n\n2.5 \n\nThis guidance is intended to be applicable to the predisposal management of \nradioactive material and radioactive waste, at all nuclear facilities on nuclear licensed \nsites, including nuclear power plant, nuclear chemical plant, storage facilities and \ndisposal facilities.

It includes all forms of radioactive material and radioactive \nwaste: solid, liquid and gaseous. \n\n2.7 \n\nKey terms pertinent to the management of radioactive material and radioactive waste \nare defined as follows: \n\nAccumulation \u2013 The gathering or amassing of radioactive material or \nradioactive waste in any form; \n\nProcessing \u2013 Any operation that changes the characteristics of the waste, \nincluding pre-treatment, treatment and conditioning; \n\nKeeping \u2013 Possession of radioactive material with the intention of use for the \npurpose for which it was obtained; \n\nStorage \u2013 Emplacement of radioactive material and radioactive waste in an \nappropriate engineered facility with the intention of retrieval; \n\nDisposal \u2013 Emplacement of solid radioactive waste in an appropriate \nengineered facility without the intention of retrieval and release of liquid or \ngaseous radioactive waste to the environment, referred to as discharge. \n\n3. \n\nRELATIONSHIP TO LICENCE AND OTHER RELEVANT LEGISLATION \n\nNuclear Site Licence Conditions \n\n3.1 \n\nAll of the licence conditions (LCs) apply and are relevant to activities involving the \nmanagement of radioactive material and radioactive waste [8].  However, there are a \nnumber of LCs that are of particular relevance: \n\nLC4  Restrictions on nuclear matter on the site \n\nLC5  Consignment of nuclear matter \n\nLC6  Documents, records, authorities and certificates \n\nLC15  Periodic review \n\nLC17  Management systems \n\nLC23  Operating rules \n\nLC25  Operational records \n\nLC28  Examination, inspection, maintenance and testing \n\nLC32  Accumulation of radioactive waste \n\nLC33  Disposal of radioactive waste \n\nLC34  Leakage and escape of radioactive material and radioactive waste \n\nLC35  Decommissioning. \n\nIonising Radiation Regulations 2017 \n\n3.2 \n\nThe Ionising Radiations Regulations 2017 (IRR17) control the use of ionising radiation \nin the workplace with the intent of restricting exposure and limiting dose to the \nworkforce and the public [10].  Some of the regulations are particularly relevant to the \nmanagement of radioactive material and radioactive waste, examples include: \n\n\uf06e \n\nRegulation 8  (radiation risk assessments) \n\nReport : NS-TAST-GD-24 Revision 6 \nCM9 Ref.: 2019/254780 \n\nPage 3 of 27 \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n\fOffice for Nuclear Regulation \n \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\nRegulation 9   (restriction of exposure) \n\nRegulation 12  (dose limitation) \n\nRegulation 29  (accounting for radioactive substances) \n\nRegulation 30  (keeping and moving of radioactive substances). \n\nThe Carriage of Dangerous Goods and Use of Transportable Pressure \nEquipment Regulations 2009 \n\n3.3 \n\n3.4 \n\n3.5 \n\n3.6 \n\n3.7 \n\n3.8 \n\nLegislation governing intra-national and international transport of radioactive materials \nis based on IAEA Regulations for the Safe Transport of Radioactive Materials, \ncurrently Specific Safety Requirements No. SSR-6 (SSR-6).  These regulations are \ntranslated into European modal regulations (e.g. the Agreement concerning the \nInternational Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road (ADR) and Rail (RID) transport, \nrespectively), within which radioactive materials are referred to as Class 7 (out of 9 \nclasses) Dangerous Goods.  The modal regulations are given legal effect in Great \nBritain via the Carriage of Dangerous Goods and Use of Transportable Pressure \nEquipment Regulations (CDG) [11].  Specific paragraphs within the regulations \nprescribe the different safety requirements for radioactive material, packagings and \npackages (see NS-TAST-GD-99 for further details [2]). \n\nEnvironmental Permitting Regulations 2016 \n\nThe Environment Agency (EA) and Natural Resources Wales (NRW) regulate the \ndisposal of radioactive waste from nuclear licensed sites under the Environmental \nPermitting Regulations 2016 (EPR16) in England and Wales, respectively [12]. \n\nNuclear licensees in England and Wales are exempt from the EPR16 requirement to \nobtain a permit from the relevant environmental regulator to accumulate radioactive \nwaste and/or keep and use radioactive material (EPR16 Schedule 23). \n\nFor further guidance on how ONR works with the environmental regulators on matters \nof mutual interest, see the Memoranda of Understanding for EA [13] and NRW [14] \nand supporting guidance [15] and [16], respectively. \n\nEnvironmental Authorisations (Scotland) Regulations 2018 \n\nThe Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) regulates the management and \ndisposal of radioactive waste on nuclear licensed sites under the Environmental \nAuthorisations (Scotland) Regulations 2018 (EASR18) in Scotland [17].  SEPA has \nalso published guidance on its standard conditions for authorisations for radioactive \nsubstances activities [18]. \n\nNuclear licensees in Scotland now require a permit from SEPA for the management of \nradioactive waste on site, and for the long term storage of radioactive waste prior to \ndisposal (EASR18 Schedule 8).  Inspectors should be aware that SEPA\u2019s duties and \npowers now explicitly apply to any activities involved in the management of radioactive \nwaste on nuclear licensed sites, in so far as such activities have the potential to give \nrise to exposures to the environment or the public, now or in the future.  Nuclear \nlicensees in Scotland remain exempt from the requirement for a permit from SEPA to \nkeep and use radioactive material on nuclear licensed sites. \n\n3.9 \n\nONR and SEPA have agreed to work together to ensure that ONR\u2019s principal function \nand SEPA\u2019s general purpose can be achieved.  This agreement is reflected in the \nupdated MoU between ONR and SEPA [19] and the associated MoU Guidance [20]. \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\nReport : NS-TAST-GD-24 Revision 6 \nCM9 Ref.: 2019/254780 \n\nPage 4 of 27 \n\n\fOffice for Nuclear Regulation \n \n\n4. \n\nRELATIONSHIP TO SAPS, WENRA REFERENCE LEVELS AND IAEA SAFETY \nSTANDARDS \n\nSafety Assessment Principles \n\n4.1 \n\nThe SAPs provide nuclear inspectors with a framework for making consistent \nregulatory judgements on the safety of activities on nuclear installations, and also \nrecognises the legal duty on licensees to reduce risk so far as is reasonably \npracticable (SFAIRP).  The SAPs are split into sections relating to different aspects of \nnuclear safety.  One section of the SAPs is dedicated to radioactive waste and those \nprinciples are summarised here: \n\n\uf06e \n\nRW.1 \u2013 Strategies for radioactive waste \n\nA strategy should be produced and implemented for the management of \nradioactive waste on site \n\n\uf06e \n\nRW.2 \u2013 Generation of radioactive waste \n\nThe generation of radioactive waste should be prevented or, where it is not \nreasonably practicable, minimised in terms of quantity and activity \n\n\uf06e \n\nRW.3 \u2013 Accumulation of radioactive waste \n\nThe total quantity of waste accumulated on site at any time should be \nminimised so far as is reasonably practicable \n\n\uf06e \n\nRW.4 \u2013 Characterisation and segregation \n\nRadioactive waste should be characterised and segregated to facilitate its \nsubsequent safe and effective management \n\n\uf06e \n\nRW.5 \u2013 Storage of radioactive waste and passive safety \n\nRadioactive waste should be stored in accordance with good engineering \npractice and in a passively safe condition \n\n\uf06e \n\nRW.6 \u2013 Passive safety timescales \n\nRadiological hazards should be reduced systematically and progressively.  The \nwaste should be processed into a passive state as soon as is reasonably \npracticable \n\n\uf06e \n\nRW.7 \u2013 Making and keeping records \n\nInformation that might be needed for the current and future safe management \nof radioactive waste should be recorded and preserved. \n\n4.2 \n\nIn addition to the RW SAPs, the following SAPs may also be of particular relevance to \nboth radioactive material and radioactive waste: \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\nFP.8 \u2013 one of the fundamental principles that underpin the SAPs and which \noutlines ONR\u2019s expectations regarding protection of present and future \ngenerations. \n\nSC.1, SC.3 to SC.8 \u2013 these principles relate to the process for producing safety \ncases, including their characteristics, content, maintenance and ownership. \n\nRP.1 to RP.7 \u2013 these principles relate to radiation protection and control of \nareas to limit spread of radioactive contamination. \n\nENM.1 to ENM.6 \u2013 these principles relate to the control of nuclear matter on \nthe nuclear licensed site. \n\nDC.1 to DC.9 \u2013 these principles relate to arrangements for decommissioning of \na facility, which apply at all stages of the lifecycle of a facility. \n\nReport : NS-TAST-GD-24 Revision 6 \nCM9 Ref.: 2019/254780 \n\nPage 5 of 27 \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n\f\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\nOffice for Nuclear Regulation \n \n\n \n \nRL.1 to RL.8 \u2013 these principles relate to land quality management. \n\nECS.1 to ECS.5 \u2013 these principles relate to classification and standards of \nstructures, systems and components (SSC) employed to deliver safety \nfunctions. \n\nEMT.2 \u2013 this principle relates to the regular and systematic examination, \ninspection, maintenance and testing of SSC. \n\nEAD.1 to EAD.5 \u2013 these principles relate to the management of ageing and \ndegradation of SSCs that may be required for the full lifetime of the facility. \n\nTechnical Assessment Guides \n\n4.3 \n\nThere are a number of other TAGs that may be of relevance to the management of \nradioactive material and radioactive waste [2]: \n\nNS-TAST-GD-005  ONR guidance on the demonstration of ALARP; \n\nNS-TAST-GD-023  Control of processes involving nuclear matter; \n\nNS-TAST-GD-026  Decommissioning on nuclear licensed sites; \n\nNS-TAST-GD-033  Duty holder management of records; \n\nNS-TAST-GD-081 \n\nSafety aspects specific to storage of spent nuclear fuel; \n\nNS-TAST-GD-083 \n\nLand quality management; \n\nNS-TAST-GD-101  Geological disposal. \n\nIAEA Requirements and WENRA Safety Reference Levels \n\n4.4 \n\nIn addition to the SAPs, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Safety \nStandards and the Safety Reference Levels (SRLs) developed by the Western \nEuropean Nuclear Regulators Association (WENRA) are considered to be UK relevant \ngood practice (RGP). \n\n4.5 \n\nThe most relevant IAEA documents are: \n\nGeneral Safety Requirements: Predisposal Management of Radioactive Waste \n(GSR Part 5) [4]; \n\nSafety Specific Guide: Predisposal Management of Radioactive Waste from \nNuclear Power Plants and Research Reactors (SSG-40) [21]; \n\nSafety Specific Guide: Predisposal Management of Radioactive Waste from \nNuclear Fuel Cycle Facilities (SSG-41) [22]. \n\n4.6 \n\nThe most relevant WENRA SRLs for the management of radioactive waste are: \n\nWaste and spent fuel storage [5]; \n\nTreatment and conditioning of radioactive waste [6]; \n\n4.7 \n\nThe IAEA requirements and WENRA SRLs have been explicitly considered during \ndevelopment of this TAG. \n\n5. \n\nGOVERNMENT POLICY \n\n5.1 \n\nThe last full review of Government policy on radioactive waste was in 1994/95; the \nconclusions were set out in Cm2919 [23]. \n\n5.2 \n\nThe following key principles arose from this policy: \n\n\uf06e \n\nRadioactive wastes should not be unnecessarily created; \n\nReport : NS-TAST-GD-24 Revision 6 \nCM9 Ref.: 2019/254780 \n\nPage 6 of 27 \n\n \n \n\n\fOffice for Nuclear Regulation \n \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\nSuch wastes as are created should be safely and appropriately managed and \ntreated; and \n\nWastes should be safely disposed of at appropriate times and in appropriate \nways. \n\n5.3 \n\nThese are underpinned by general requirements that: \n\nRadioactive waste will be manages and disposed of in ways which protect the \npublic, workforce and environment; and \n\nRadioactive waste management should safeguard the interest of existing and \nfuture generations and the wider environment, and in a manner that commands \npublic confidence and takes due account of costs. \n\n5.4 \n\n5.5 \n\n5.6 \n\nRadioactive waste disposal is a devolved matter in the UK, and the relevant \nGovernmental bodies have since elaborated on various aspects of policy as described \nin the following sections. \n\nThe following sections on radioactive waste management policies in the UK refer to \nspecific classifications of waste: higher activity radioactive waste (HAW) and low level \nwaste (LLW).  Further information on these and other waste classifications is provided \nin Reference [23] and Appendix A. \n\nPolicy for HAW (England and Wales) \n\nIn 2006 the Committee for Radioactive Waste Management (CoRWM) published its \nrecommendations for the long term management of higher activity wastes (HAW) [24].  \nIn response, the UK Government established that deep geological disposal is the \npreferred route for HAW in England and Wales.  Since then, the Government has set \nout (in 2008) and updated (in 2014 and 2018) the framework for managing HAW in the \nlong term through geological disposal, coupled with safe and secure interim storage \nand on-going research and development to support its optimised implementation: \n\nManaging Radioactive Waste Safely (MRWS), 2008 [25] \n\nImplementing Geological Disposal, 2014 [26] \n\nImplementing Geological Disposal \u2013 Working With Communities, 2018 [27]. \n\n5.7 \n\nThe Welsh Government has adopted the policy of geological disposal for the long term \nmanagement of HAW; their current policy is set out in the following documents: \n\nWelsh Government Policy on the Management and Disposal of Higher Activity \nRadioactive Waste, 2015 [28] \n\nGeological Disposal of Higher Activity Waste: Community Engagement and \nSiting Process, 2015 [29] \n\nGeological Disposal of Higher Activity Waste: Working with Communities, \n2019 [30]. \n\nPolicy for HAW (Scotland) \n\n5.8 \n\nScotland's policy for HAW is that long-term management of HAW should be in near-\nsurface facilities which should be located as near to the site where the waste is \nproduced as possible so that the need to transport the waste over long distances is \nminimal.  The policy also states the need to demonstrate how facilities will be \nmonitored and how waste packages, or waste could be retrieved.  The current policy is \nset out in the following documents: \n\n\uf06e \n\nScotland\u2019s Higher Activity Radioactive Waste Policy, 2011 [31] \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\nReport : NS-TAST-GD-24 Revision 6 \nCM9 Ref.: 2019/254780 \n\nPage 7 of 27 \n\n\fOffice for Nuclear Regulation \n \n\n\uf06e \n\nImplementation Strategy for Scotland\u2019s Policy on Higher Activity Radioactive \nWaste, 2016 [32]. \n\nPolicy for LLW (UK) \n\n5.9 \n\nThe UK policy for the management of solid low level waste (LLW) is set out in the \nfollowing document: \n\n\uf06e \n\nPolicy for the Long Term Management of Solid Low Level Radioactive Waste in \nthe United Kingdom, 2007 [33]. \n\n5.10  A complementary UK Strategy on solid LLW was published in 2016 [34].  The key aim \n\nof the LLW policy is to provide a high-level framework within which individual LLW \nmanagement decisions can be taken flexibly, to ensure safe, environmentally-\nacceptable and cost-effective management solutions that appropriately reflect the \nnature of the LLW concerned. \n\n5.11  A key component of the policy is definitions for Low Level Waste as in Appendix A. \n\n5.12 \n\nIn its policy, Government looks to the various regulators to maximise the consistency \nof their approaches in regulating radioactive waste management, including disposal of \nLLW, and on matters relating to delicensing and clean-up of nuclear sites and other \nland contaminated by radioactivity.  Government also looks to the regulatory bodies to \nmake clear, through published material, the steps that have been taken to address this \nrequirement. \n\n5.13 \n\nIn its policy, Government states that plans for the management of all radioactive waste, \nincluding LLW, must be developed by waste managers.  These plans must be \nprepared in a form, and to a level of detail, suitable for consideration by the relevant \nregulatory bodies. \n\n5.14  All nuclear licensed sites should have a plan for the management of their LLW \n\nholdings and predicted future arisings that is part of a wider integrated waste \nmanagement strategy, and is compatible with proposed end states. \n\n5.15  The environment agencies\u2019 guidance on the decommissioning and clean-up of nuclear \n\nlicensed sites sets out their expectations for waste management plans [35]. \n\n6. \n\nADVICE TO INSPECTORS \n\nFundamental expectations \n\n6.1 \n\nONR has four fundamental expectations, which it expects licensees to meet so far as \nis reasonably practicable.  These expectations are as follows: \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\nGeneration of radioactive waste should be avoided, where radioactive waste is \nunavoidable, generation should be minimised according to the waste hierarchy \n\nRadioactive material and radioactive waste should be managed safely \nthroughout its lifecycle in a manner that is consistent with modern standards \n\nPredisposal management of radioactive waste should take account of the \nanticipated disposal route, and full use should be made of existing routes \n\nWhere the disposal route is not yet available, radioactive material and \nradioactive waste should be put into a passively safe state as soon as \nreasonably practicable for interim storage pending future disposal, or other \nlong-term solution. \n\n6.2 \n\nThese fundamental expectations should form a common thread through any \nassessment relating to the management of radioactive waste or radioactive material. \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\nReport : NS-TAST-GD-24 Revision 6 \nCM9 Ref.: 2019/254780 \n\nPage 8 of 27 \n\n\fOffice for Nuclear Regulation \n \n\n \n \nJoint Guidance on the Management of Higher Activity Radioactive Waste on \nNuclear Licensed Sites \n\n6.3  Whilst ONR regulates the management of radioactive waste on nuclear licensed sites \n\nand the environment agencies regulate disposals, the regulators work together on \ndecisions concerning permissioning of activities relating to HAW [36].  This is \nnecessary to ensure both safety and environmental protection can be achieved over \nthe long timescales associated with the management of HAW. \n\n6.4 \n\n6.5 \n\n6.6 \n\n6.7 \n\n6.8 \n\n6.9 \n\nTo this end, the environment agencies and ONR have published joint guidance on the \nmanagement of HAW on nuclear licensed sites [37] (the Joint Guidance).  The Joint \nGuidance covers all aspects relating to the safe and secure management of HAW \nproduced on nuclear licensed sites. \n\nIn assessments relating to HAW, inspectors should look to the Joint Guidance for \nfurther details on joint regulatory expectations.  However, the principles therein may \nalso be relevant to the management of other radioactive waste, and also to radioactive \nmaterial, for example spent fuel. \n\nIn addition to providing guidance on regulatory expectations for the management of \nHAW, the Joint Guidance also describes the regulatory process by which licensees \nmay obtain regulatory acceptance of their proposals. \n\nStrategies for the management of radioactive waste \n\nIn line with Government Policy [23], ONR expects licensees to produce and maintain a \nstrategy that describes their approach to the current and future management of \nradioactive material and radioactive waste.  If a licensee is responsible for a number of \nsites, then it may be appropriate for the licensee to produce a corporate strategy \nsupported by a series of site-specific strategies. \n\nIn selecting a preferred strategy, licensees should demonstrate that a full range of \nmanagement options have been examined, taking account of all technical factors, \nsocial factors, Government Policies and international agreements.  The reasons for \nreaching the preferred strategy should be recorded and major assumptions and \nuncertainties should be identified, together with the approach for their resolution. \n\nThe scope of the strategy should include all materials and wastes arising on a site, \nincluding secondary wastes and those expected to arise from final decommissioning.  \nThe strategy should take account of interdependencies between waste streams and \nprocesses among all steps to demonstrate that an optimum management process is \ndelivered. \n\n6.10  The licensee\u2019s strategy should identify the inventory of its nuclear liabilities and \n\ndescribe the means of managing each waste stream from generation to disposal by \npractical and cost-effective methods.  The strategy should cover the complete lifecycle \nof the material and associated facilities, and should include routine discharges of liquid \nand gaseous radioactive wastes.  The strategy should not be restricted to the \nconsideration of nuclear matter that licensees currently regard as radioactive waste: it \nshould also cover all radioactive material, including materials held up in store prior to \noperational use, spent nuclear fuel, other stocks of fissile and recyclable material and \nradioactively contaminated land (referred to as an \u2018accumulation of nuclear matter\u2019; \nsee NS-TAST-GD-83 [2]). \n\n6.11  The strategy should describe how the licensee will provide and maintain the \n\narrangements to ensure that the radioactive material and radioactive waste is \nmanaged safely until its ultimate disposal, including the provision of an appropriate \norganisation and supporting infrastructure. \n\nReport : NS-TAST-GD-24 Revision 6 \nCM9 Ref.: 2019/254780 \n\nPage 9 of 27 \n\n \n \n\n\fOffice for Nuclear Regulation \n \n\n \n \n6.12  The strategy should be linked to, or integrated with the strategy for decommissioning of \nnuclear facilities including the management of radioactively contaminated land and the \nability to dispose of the resulting wastes. \n\n6.13  The strategy should demonstrate how the objectives of the OSPAR Convention have \n\nbeen taken into account, in particular, the impact on the volume and total activity of on-\nsite waste arisings of solid and liquid wastes, options for storage and ultimate disposal, \nand implications for compliance with the ALARP principle.  The UK strategy for \nradioactive discharges, which was reviewed in 2018 [38], aims to prevent pollution of \nthe OSPAR maritime area (the North East Atlantic) from radiation through progressive \nand substantial reductions of discharges, emissions and losses of radioactive \nsubstances. \n\n6.14  The manner and form in which they choose to prepare, maintain and document the \n\ninformation relating to their strategies is a matter for the licensees.  It is not the aim of \nthis guidance to be prescriptive; however, strategies are expected to contain the \nfollowing elements: \n\n\uf06e \n\nDescriptions of: \n\n\uf0b7 \n\uf0b7 \n\n\uf0b7 \n\n\uf0b7 \n\n\uf0b7 \n\nthe licensee\u2019s radioactive waste management objectives and policy; \nthe current and future waste inventory, including decommissioning \nwastes and radioactive materials that may be declared as waste in the \nfuture; \nthe preferred option for managing each waste stream throughout its \nlifecycle to disposal, including programmes showing timescales, \nmethods and proposed disposal route.  For wastes where disposition is \nnot defined fully or optimised, a description of the management \narrangements for these, including strategies to minimise generation of \nthese in future; \nthe justification of the preferred option based on ALARP and Best \nAvailable Techniques (BAT), including the alternative options examined, \nthe selection factors taken into account, major assumptions and the \navailability of disposal routes; \nhow the balance between foreclosure of disposal options and passive \nsafety has been addressed, and resolved in cases where there may be \nconflict. \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\nDemonstration of consistency with Government Policy and ONR\u2019s fundamental \nexpectations for radioactive waste management; \n\nSignificant uncertainties should be identified, the impact assessed and the \napproach for resolution described; \n\nResults of analyses to assess the sensitivity of the selection of the preferred \noption to assumptions, uncertainties and factors; \n\nApproach to ensuring safety including, where appropriate, demonstration that \nhazards posed by legacy wastes are being adequately controlled and \nprogressively reduced; \n\nCorporate arrangements and infrastructure for continuing capability to meet \nlicensee responsibilities. \n\n6.15  The strategy should contain sufficient detail to be standalone, but may be supported by \na number of other documents, including individual documents describing waste stream \nlifecycle management, site lifetime plan, site decommissioning strategy and site \nstrategy for end states.  In some cases, the strategy may be encompassed by existing \ndocuments, such as Waste Management Plans for LLW. \n\nReport : NS-TAST-GD-24 Revision 6 \nCM9 Ref.: 2019/254780 \n\nPage 10 of 27 \n\n \n \n\n\fOffice for Nuclear Regulation \n \n\n \n \n6.16  Further guidance on the production of radioactive waste strategies can be found in the \nJoint Guidance [37].  Licensees may choose to present their strategy in the form of an \nIntegrated Waste Strategy (IWS) document, for which NDA has produced guidance on \nthe form and content of such documents [39]. \n\nApplication of ALARP across the lifecycle \n\n6.17  ONR expects licensees to manage radioactive waste in a manner that is compatible \n\nwith ultimate disposal, or other long-term solution, and, unless justified on safety \ngrounds, does not unnecessarily foreclose any foreseeable management options.  The \nrisks should be assessed in a holistic manner and not restricted to part of the overall \ntime period. \n\n6.18  However, the nature of radioactive waste management means that multiple facilities \n\nare likely to be involved in the different aspects relating to generation, processing, \nstorage, transport and disposal, and for HAW, these activities are expected to take \nplace over a significant period of time.  Safety cases specific to individual facilities in \nradioactive waste management are unlikely to provide sufficient information on the \ncase for the management that covers the whole waste lifecycle. \n\n6.19  Additionally, there may be situations, particularly during post operation clean-out and \n\ndecommissioning, where the risks may increase temporarily so that the long-term risks \ncan then be reduced or eliminated.  Such increased risks need to be balanced against \nthe continuing risks from doing nothing and with due consideration of the alternatives \navailable to address the hazard. \n\n6.20  Therefore, the case for safe management of some waste streams across their whole \n\nlifecycle needs to be considered on a case-by-case basis, taking account of all factors, \nto ensure that an appropriate balance is achieved.  These factors include requirements \nimposed by the environmental permit (including optimisation, BAT and disposability) \nand any waste acceptance criteria for the final disposal facility.  The licensee also \nneeds to address the risk that future disposal options may require the wastes to be \nreworked into an alternative form and also that reworking may be necessary as a result \nof deterioration of the waste packages or accidental damage.  For HAW, Radioactive \nWaste Management Ltd. (RWM) has an advisory role, and it is for the licensee to seek \nappropriate advice from RWM.  The advice may be used by the licensee as part of the \ncase for safe management of the waste across the lifecycle. \n\n6.21 \n\nIn addition to the requirement to produce adequate facility safety cases, licensees \nshould also demonstrate how the key elements of long-term safety and environmental \nperformance will be delivered for the management of radioactive waste across the \nlifecycle, which may not be addressed in the individual plant safety cases and \nenvironmental documentation.  Where waste is transferred between multiple plants or \nsites, good practice would suggest production of the case for its overall management \nearly in the waste stream lifecycle, enabling its maintenance and update upon \nsubsequent transfer(s).  The case for a particular waste stream should cover the \nperiod from generation, through processing, storage, transport and up to the removal \nof the waste stream from site for eventual disposal, or other long-term solution. \n\n6.22  The manner and form in which they choose to prepare, maintain and document the \n\ninformation relating to the case for management of radioactive waste is a matter for the \nlicensees, and should be proportionate to the hazard presented by the waste.  \nLicensees may choose to present their case in the form of a Radioactive Waste \nManagement Case (RWMC).  Further guidance on the form and content of RWMCs for \nHAW can be found in the Joint Guidance [37]. \n\nReport : NS-TAST-GD-24 Revision 6 \nCM9 Ref.: 2019/254780 \n\nPage 11 of 27 \n\n \n \n\n\fOffice for Nuclear Regulation \n \n\nPredisposal management of radioactive waste \n\n6.23  Radioactive waste should be managed in a manner that minimises the need for \n\nprocessing, and that it is compatible with anticipated facilities for ultimate disposal or \nlong-term solution. \n\n6.24  The following steps, as identified in GSR Part 5 and discussed in more detail below, \n\nare key to the safe management of radioactive waste: \n\nGeneration \n\nProcessing \n\nStorage \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\nWaste acceptance criteria. \n\n6.25  Whilst the next sections are focussed on the predisposal management of radioactive \nwastes, many of the principles may be applicable to the management of radioactive \nmaterials.  Further guidance on the predisposal management of HAW can be found in \nthe Joint Guidance [37]. \n\nGeneration \n\n6.26  Licensees should demonstrate that radioactive waste is not unnecessarily created, and \n\nthat the generation and accumulation of radioactive waste is minimised. \n\n6.27  Licence Condition 32 requires licensees to make and implement adequate \n\narrangements for minimising, so far as is reasonably practicable, the rate of production \nand total quantity of radioactive waste accumulated on site.  Licence Condition 4(1) \nrequires licensees to ensure that no nuclear matter is brought onto site, except in \naccordance with adequate arrangements for this purpose. \n\n6.28  The licensee should demonstrate that adequate steps have been taken first to avoid \n\nthe creation of radioactive waste, and then to minimise the amount generated, both in \nterms of volume and activity, initially in the design phase and then throughout the \nlifetime of facilities that generate or manage radioactive waste.  Generation also \nincludes the transfer of radioactive material or radioactive waste from other national \nand international sites; where this occurs, ownership shall be clear and unequivocal. \n\n6.29  The licensee should demonstrate suitable and sufficient design features and \n\noperational procedures to support the management of radioactive waste, which should \nbe subject to systematic review and review as necessary. \n\n6.30  The licensee\u2019s approach to the minimisation of radioactive waste shall include \n\napplication of the waste management hierarchy, the key principles of which should be \nreflected within the operational procedures.  Inspectors should be cognisant that \nlicensees are also required by the environment agencies to demonstrate that waste \nmanagement options have been optimised using BAT; this should be balanced with \nONR\u2019s requirement for risks to be ALARP (see NS-TAST-GD-005 on the \ndemonstration of ALARP [2]).  ONR\u2019s expectations for the application of waste \nminimisation, which encompass the waste hierarchy, include the following: \n\nMinimisation of the production of secondary wastes; \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\nSegregation of waste streams; \n\nPreventing spread of contamination; \n\nRecycling and reusing material; \n\nClearance and exemption; \n\nReport : NS-TAST-GD-24 Revision 6 \nCM9 Ref.: 2019/254780 \n\nPage 12 of 27 \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n\fOffice for Nuclear Regulation \n \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\nActivity reduction; \n\nVolume reduction; \n\nDisposal. \n\n6.31  The generation of wastes that may be difficult to convert into a passive form for \n\nstorage, or for which there is no obvious disposal route should be avoided; these \nwastes may be classed by licensees as \u2018problematic\u2019 or \u2018orphan\u2019 wastes.  Where these \nwastes exist, licensees should demonstrate adequate arrangements for their \nmanagement, and further arisings of problematic wastes are minimised. \n\n6.32  The licensee should, so far as is reasonably practicable, characterise and segregate \nradioactive waste in order to facilitate safe and effective management and disposal. \n\n6.33  The radioactive waste should be characterised in terms of its physical, mechanical, \n\nchemical, radiological and biological properties, along with its source or origin.  \nLicensees should develop a systematic approach to characterisation that takes \naccount of regulatory expectations for control and management over the entire lifetime \nof the radioactive waste, including disposal, or other long-term solution.  \nCharacterisation should be done as soon as practicable to inform onward \nmanagement, but further characterisation may be required at any of the subsequent \nsteps in predisposal management.  Licensees should also take into account the \nrequirements for Nuclear Material Accountancy and Control (NMAC) for Safeguards \npurposes. \n\n6.34  Segregation involves accumulating those materials with similar characteristics, and \n\nseparating or avoiding mixing those with different characteristics.  Where practicable, \nradioactive waste should be segregated as close to the point of generation as possible.  \nSegregation is most effective if it is taken into account at the process design stage and \ncan contribute significantly to the effective and safe management of radioactive waste.  \nSome legacy wastes have arisen because incompatible wastes have been mixed \ninappropriately, without due consideration of ALARP across the lifecycle. \n\n6.35  Pre-treatment operations may also be employed to minimise the amount of radioactive \nwaste to be further processed, stored and disposed of.  These operations, for example \ndecontamination and incineration, may be employed in order to allow reclassification of \nthe waste at a lower level or to allow the waste to be cleared from regulatory control \n(see Appendix A).  Additionally, licensees may opt for decay storage in cases where \nwastes are borderline in terms of classification; ONR expects this alternative approach \nto be justified in terms of ALARP and underpinned as part of the overall waste \nstrategy. \n\nProcessing \n\n6.36  Licensees should process radioactive waste into a passively safe state as soon as is \nreasonably practicable.  Appendix B provides general principles for radioactive waste \nmanagement. \n\n6.37  Radioactive waste should be processed as close to the point of generation as \n\npracticable and in a form suitable for subsequent waste management steps.  Passive \nsafety is most appropriately achieved by providing multiple physical barriers to the \nrelease of radioactivity to the environment, which should be designed to provide \neffective containment and prevent leakage.  These barriers include the form of the raw \nor processed waste, and the packaging, where appropriate. \n\n6.38  To achieve passive safety, the radioactivity should be immobilised, and packaged in a \nform that is physically and chemically stable.  For some wastes, the radioactivity may \nbe immobilised by virtue of the nature of the material, for example, activated \nuncontaminated metals.  The term \u2018passive safety\u2019 is more usually associated with \n\nReport : NS-TAST-GD-24 Revision 6 \nCM9 Ref.: 2019/254780 \n\nPage 13 of 27 \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n\fOffice for Nuclear Regulation \n \n\nwastes that have already been processed for long-term storage, pending disposal.  \nHowever, passive safe storage should be provided at all stages in predisposal \nmanagement of all radioactive waste, to ensure isolation and for environmental \nprotection. \n\n6.39  Passive safety is most relevant in cases where radioactive wastes need to be \n\nmanaged in the long-term, for example HAW, where the disposal route is not yet \navailable.  However, ONR expects licensees to consider proportionate application of \nthe principles of passive safety in the management of all radioactive wastes (see \nAppendix B). \n\n6.40  ONR expects licensees to demonstrate that their processing of radioactive waste will \nnot unnecessarily foreclose future management options, unless there are worthwhile \nsafety benefits.  There may be potential for a conflict between the expectations not to \nforeclose options with expectations for achieving passive safety.  In such cases, all \nrelevant factors will need to be taken into account and a judgement made that an \nappropriate balance has been achieved, and which considers radioactive waste \nmanagement across the lifecycle. \n\n6.41  There are a number of factors that could influence the timing of the implementation of \n\npassive safety, such as: \n\nThe magnitude of the radioactive hazard; \n\nThe current form of the radioactive waste; \n\nThe safety of the current facilities in which accumulation of raw waste is taking, \nor has taken place; \n\nThe rate of deterioration of the facilities; \n\nThe rate of deterioration in the condition of the radioactive waste; \n\nUncertainty in the knowledge of the waste; \n\nIntegration with decommissioning plans; \n\nRadioactive decay or ingrowth; \n\nThe availability of a disposal route; \n\nThe need for active safety systems. \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n6.42  Radioactive waste processing may comprise treatment and/or conditioning, with the \nultimate goal of producing a waste product that is suitable for disposal.  Examples of \ntreatment options include filtration, ion exchange, incineration and size reduction; \nthese should be employed with the aim of rendering the waste into a state that \nfacilitates conditioning of solid and some liquid wastes, or discharge of liquid and \ngaseous wastes.  Conditioning consists of operations that produce a waste product \nsuitable for safe handling, storage and disposal, taking account of the timescales \nexpected for these onward activities.  Examples of conditioning operations include \nencapsulation of the wastes in a suitable matrix, for example cementitious grout, \nvitrification or drying of the wastes. \n\n6.43  The processing techniques should be selected on the basis of the characteristics \n\n(including non-radiological) of the waste concerned, as these may affect safety during \nprocessing and the suitability of the product for onward management to disposal.  The \nlicensee should describe the expected properties of the intended waste product and \nensure that adequate controls are applied to processes and activities to achieve \nconsistent, safe outcomes. \n\n6.44  For conditioned wastes, the waste packaging should be selected such that it \n\ncontributes to passive safety over the expected timescales.  Dependent on the nature \n\nReport : NS-TAST-GD-24 Revision 6 \nCM9 Ref.: 2019/254780 \n\nPage 14 of 27 \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n\fOffice for Nuclear Regulation \n \n\nof the waste and the hazard it presents, the packaging may need to provide shielding \nin addition to containment, and may also need to take account of criticality safety and \nheat-bearing wastes. \n\n6.45  Waste products should be uniquely identifiable via appropriate labelling, which should \nbe designed to ensure identification over the expected period and conditions of \npassive safe storage.  Licensees should ensure that labelling of waste packages for \ndisposal is compliant with the requirements set out by the disposal facility. \n\n6.46  Licence Condition 17 requires licensees to make and implement adequate quality \nmanagement arrangements in respect of all matters which may affect safety.  With \nrespect to the predisposal management of radioactive waste, licensees are expected \nto make and implement adequate arrangements for quality control and quality \nassurance procedures for the processing and packaging of radioactive waste.  These \narrangements should ensure that the waste products comply with the relevant \nspecifications, including those of the final disposal facility, or discharge routes for liquid \nand gaseous wastes.  These arrangements should cover the procurement of the \npackaging and any raw materials used in processing, the quality of the final product \nand all necessary records. \n\nStorage \n\n6.47  Licensees should, so far as is reasonably practicable, store radioactive waste in a \n\npassively safe state, such that it can be inspected, monitored, retrieved and preserved \nin a condition suitable for its subsequent management. \n\n6.48  Licence Condition 4(2) requires licensees to ensure that nuclear matter is stored in \n\naccordance with adequate arrangements made for this purpose.  Licence Condition 34 \nrequires the licensee to ensure, so far as is reasonably practicable, that radioactive \nmaterial and radioactive waste is adequately controlled or contained so that it cannot \nleak or otherwise escape. \n\n6.49  Storage of radioactive waste is by definition an interim measure and can occur at, or \n\nbetween, any steps in predisposal management from generation to disposal, including \ndecay storage as a step on the way to disposal.  The storage vessel, for example \ntanks containing raw liquid wastes or conditioned waste packages, and the storage \nbuilding or structure form part of the multi-barrier system and should be designed to \nprovide effective containment and prevent leakage.  In some cases, the role of the \nstorage building or structure may be limited to providing environmental protection, \nradiation shielding and presenting a secure boundary against unauthorised intrusion or \ninterference and entry of wildlife. \n\n6.50  The licensee should demonstrate that the design of the storage building or structure is \n\nfit for purpose, taking account of the hazards posed by the stored radioactive waste \nand the expected timescales for passive safe storage, which could extend beyond 100 \nyears in some cases.  There should be sufficient storage capacity for waste generated \nduring normal operations, and consideration given to reserve capacity in case of \nincidents or abnormal events.  For storage of liquid wastes, this should include an \nadequate provision of secondary containment. \n\n6.51  Licensees may wish to use temporary facilities for radioactive waste storage in the \n\nshort-term to support other processes, for example decommissioning, retrieval of \nradioactive waste for disposal or passive safe storage, or pending construction of other \nfacilities.  In these cases, licensees should demonstrate that the temporary facilities \nare fit for purpose and that any risks from their use are reduced ALARP through \nprovision of an adequate safety case.  ONR expects that such arrangements to be \ntruly temporary and required for relatively short periods of time.  If such arrangements \nare required for longer time periods, then they cannot be regarded as temporary. \n\nReport : NS-TAST-GD-24 Revision 6 \nCM9 Ref.: 2019/254780 \n\nPage 15 of 27 \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n\fOffice for Nuclear Regulation \n \n\n6.52  Licence Condition 23 requires the licensee to identify the conditions and limits \n\nnecessary in the interests of safety (referred to as operating rules).  Licence Condition \n28 requires the licensee to make and implement adequate arrangements for the \nregular and systematic examination, inspection, maintenance and testing of all plant \nwhich may affect safety. \n\n6.53  The fundamental objective of inspection of stored radioactive waste, including \n\nunconditioned waste and waste packages is to confirm that they, and the facilities that \ncontain them, are in an acceptable condition for continuing safe storage, retrieval, \nprocessing and final disposal, and will remain so for the relevant timescales. \n\n6.54  Licensees should develop a strategy, including criteria (operating rules) against which \n\nthe condition of the stored radioactive waste and stored waste packages are to be \nassessed.  The strategy should also provide justification as to the method and \nfrequency of inspections.  Where strategies are based on predicted rates of \ndegradation, inspections should also be undertaken at appropriate time intervals to \nconfirm that the waste is not evolving to an unexpected degree.  The licensee should \nalso include consideration of the environmental conditions within the storage facility. \n\n6.55  Given that an increasing number of waste treatment and storage facilities are being \n\nconstructed and operated, there is a need to ensure that the operating rules for such \nfacilities are appropriately defined within the safety case and are set in suitably \nmeasurable terms.  It should be noted that in such cases, surveillance inspections will \nbe infrequent, with long gaps, potentially years, between inspections.  Thus, any such \noperating rules should have robust margins of safety associated with them and be \ndemonstrable within the safety case. \n\n6.56  The inspection strategy should be reviewed for adequacy at appropriate intervals, \n\ntaking account of results derived from previous inspections. \n\n6.57  Further guidance on ONR\u2019s expectations for dedicated storage facilities that is also \napplicable to waste packages is given in the TAG for Spent Fuel Management (NS-\nTAST-GD-081).  In addition, NDA has produced industry guidance on the interim \nstorage of HAW [40]. \n\nWaste Acceptance Criteria \n\n6.58  Licensees should establish acceptance criteria (operating rules) for radioactive waste \n\nand waste packages that are accepted for processing, storage, transport and disposal, \nand make arrangements for assessment against them.  The criteria should specify the \nradiological, physical, chemical and biological characteristics of the waste or waste \npackages that are to be processed or stored, taking account of the operating limits and \nconditions to ensure consistency with the safety case. \n\n6.59  Licensees should also make adequate provisions for the safe management of \n\nradioactive waste or waste packages that do not meet the criteria. \n\nData and information recording \n\n6.60  Licensees should make adequate provision for recording and preserving all the data \nand information that may be required in the future to ensure the safe management of \nradioactive material and radioactive waste, for as long as such information may be \nrequired. \n\n6.61  Licence Condition 6 requires licensees to make adequate records to demonstrate \n\ncompliance with each condition of the site licence, and to ensure that such records are \npreserved for 30 years.  Licence Condition 25 requires licensees to ensure that \nadequate records are made a kept of the operation, inspection and maintenance of \nnuclear facilities; these shall include records relating to the amount and location of all \n\nReport : NS-TAST-GD-24 Revision 6 \nCM9 Ref.: 2019/254780 \n\nPage 16 of 27 \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n\fOffice for Nuclear Regulation \n \n\nnuclear matter.  Licence Condition 32 requires licensees to make adequate \narrangements for the recording the amount of radioactive waste accumulated on site. \n\n6.62  The record preservation period of 30 years reflects the requirements of NIA65 with \n\nrespect to third party liability.  This period starts from the time when decommissioning \nor decontamination of the plant is complete and all radioactive waste has been \ntransferred to another location or disposed of.  However, records required to support \nthe safe management of radioactive waste during long-term storage and final disposal \nwill need to be managed by the licensee over a significant period of time prior to \ndisposal, and subsequently by the operator of the disposal facility.  As a result, the \nrecords may be required for periods in excess of 100 years and consideration needs to \nbe given to the content of such records, and the form in which they are kept.  Records \nshould be held by the licensee until the responsibility for the waste has been passed to \nanother body such as the operator of a disposal facility; however, some information will \nneed to be retained to comply with NIA65 requirements.  For on-site disposals, records \nwould need to be maintained until the site is released from regulation. \n\n6.63  ONR expects licensees to develop and maintain a records system that takes into \n\naccount the purpose, content and storage of records, where the records should \n\nContain all the information that may be required in the future, \n\nBe accessible and legible to those who will consult them, and \n\nBe assembled and maintained in a secure form. \n\n6.64  The information contained in records is required for two principal reasons: firstly in \n\nconnection with nuclear liabilities under NIA65, and secondly, to support the safe \nmanagement of the waste of the whole lifecycle.  This guidance is relevant to the latter, \nin particular the roles that operational records play in supporting future radioactive \nwaste management and decommissioning, including: \n\nReview of waste management (and decommissioning) strategies; \n\nReview of facility safety cases (periodic review of safety); \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\nEnsuring continued safe storage; \n\nRetrieval of waste and waste packages; \n\nPackaging or repackaging of waste; \n\nDisposal of waste; \n\nDismantling of structures and plant; \n\nManagement following incidents; \n\nMaking modifications. \n\nAny successor licensee; \n\nThe operator of a disposal facility; \n\nLocal planning authority; \n\nMembers of the public; \n\nInternational organisations (e.g. IAEA). \n\n6.65 \n\nIn addition to the regulators and the licensee, records will be of value to other \norganisations or persons in the future, for example: \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\nReport : NS-TAST-GD-24 Revision 6 \nCM9 Ref.: 2019/254780 \n\nPage 17 of 27 \n\n\fOffice for Nuclear Regulation \n \n\n6.66 \n\n \n \nIt is beyond the scope of this guidance to define the extent of the records that \nlicensees are expected to assemble with respect to their nuclear facilities, but the \nfollowing provides some guidance specifically for radioactive waste: \n\nRelevant characteristics, including radionuclide inventory, the amount, \nradiological classification, its physical, chemical and biological form, any \nassociated uncertainties in the estimates of the characteristics and any \ncriticality-relevant information; \n\nDetails of the ownership; \n\nOrigin of the waste and its location on site or within a storage facility; \n\nDevelopment and specification of waste packages, including treatment and \nconditioning; \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\nDetails of packaging; \n\nDesign and construction materials; \n\nInspection, maintenance and testing; \n\nRecords of all waste disposals; \n\nQuality records; \n\nSafety case records; \n\nRecords of incidents; \n\nResearch and development; \n\nRegulatory interactions; \n\nInteractions with operators of disposal facilities. \n\n6.67  The fundamental requirement for records storage is that they should be in a secure \n\nand accessible form for as long as the information could be of value.  Due to the long \ntimescales associated with the interim storage of HAW and some licensee\u2019s decision \nto defer decommissioning, the projected storage period for many records will be \nsignificant, in excess of 100 years in some cases, and should be taken into account in \ndeveloping the records system.  Further guidance on the management of records is \nprovided in Reference [2] (NS-TAST-GD-033). \n\nSafety management \n\n6.68  ONR expects licensees to provide safety cases demonstrating the safe operation of all \ntheir facilities, including those for the management of radioactive material and \nradioactive waste. \n\n6.69  Licence Condition (LC) 23(1) requires licensees to provide safety cases that \n\ndemonstrate the safe operation of all facilities on site, including those specifically for \nthe management of radioactive waste.  General guidance on the purpose, scope and \ncontent of safety cases for all types of nuclear facilities is available in Reference [2] \n(NS-TAST-GD-051).  However, there are a number of important issues that are \nparticularly relevant to radioactive waste management facilities, which need to be \naddressed in the safety cases. \n\n6.70  The lack of a disposal facility for HAW means that radioactive waste management \n\nfacilities will be required to operate safely for very long periods of time.  In some cases, \nthese facilities may be new, but in many other cases the plants were built a long time \nago and to different standards.  Some historical plants remain in good condition, but \nothers may be physically deteriorating.  Additionally, some historical plants may be \nrepurposed for the management of radioactive waste.  All these issues need to be \nconsidered in developing an acceptable safety case. \n\nReport : NS-TAST-GD-24 Revision 6 \nCM9 Ref.: 2019/254780 \n\nPage 18 of 27 \n\n \n \n\n\fOffice for Nuclear Regulation \n \n\n \n \n6.71  The safety case should demonstrate that the design and operation of the facility and its \nassociated arrangements meet modern standards and also justify safe operation \nthroughout the projected life of the facility.  For older facilities built to earlier standards, \nthe age of the facility, as well as the anticipated remaining lifetime, must be taken into \naccount and the issue of whether suitable and sufficient measures are available to \nsatisfy ALARP will need to be judged on a case by case basis.  A safety case \ncomprises a suite of safety documentation which, when taken together, provide this \njustification.  The specification and format of a safety case is the responsibility of the \nlicensee; however, the following elements that are particularly relevant to radioactive \nwaste management facilities should be considered: \n\n\uf06e \n\nDescriptions of facilities, environment and processes, including \n\nbuildings and plant; \nsite conditions; \nwaste streams (characterisation and quantities); \nwaste management processes; \n\nConsistency with waste management and decommissioning strategies; \n\nIdentification of modern standards and good practice; \n\nDemonstration that radioactive material and radioactive waste are adequately \ncontrolled and contained; \n\nOperations procedures, including \n\nOperating instructions; \nRelevant limits, rules and conditions for operations; \nInspection, maintenance and monitoring schedules. \n\n\uf06e \n\nDemonstration that the plant: \n\nis fit for purpose; \nis consistent with good engineering and good practice; \nprovides adequate safety throughout its proposed life; \nthat risks are reduced ALARP. \n\n\uf06e \n\nThat the ageing of structures, systems and components, plant and waste \npackages is adequately managed. \n\n6.72  Licence Condition 15 requires licensees to make and implement adequate \n\narrangements for the periodic and systematic review and assessment of safety cases.  \nFurther guidance on periodic safety reviews can be found in Reference [2] (NS-TAST-\nGD-050). \n\n6.73  The review would normally be expected to be conducted at least every 10 years and \n\nONR expects licensees to give adequate consideration to the following, as they relate \nto the management of radioactive materials and radioactive wastes: \n\nthe accumulation and monitoring of radioactive waste \n\noperating experience since the last review \n\nmaintenance, inspection and testing experience since the last review \n\nthe history of incidents and abnormal events since the last review. \n\n6.74  The review should ensure that in cases where the facility provides a safety function \nthat cannot be provided by an alternative means, the forward look includes \nconsideration of the time which may be needed to design, construct and commission, \nor to procure a replacement facility or equipment, should the original be found to be \nunserviceable at some point in the future, i.e. there must be no interruption in safety \n\nReport : NS-TAST-GD-24 Revision 6 \nCM9 Ref.: 2019/254780 \n\nPage 19 of 27 \n\n \n \n\n\uf0b7 \n\uf0b7 \n\uf0b7 \n\uf0b7 \n\n\uf0b7 \n\uf0b7 \n\uf0b7 \n\n\uf0b7 \n\uf0b7 \n\uf0b7 \n\uf0b7 \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\fOffice for Nuclear Regulation \n \n\nfunction.  This applies particularly to radioactive waste stores, and to other facilities in \nwhich the hazard cannot be simply removed by shutting them down.  For stores \ncontaining significant quantities of radioactive material and radioactive waste, the \nreview needs to consider the entire period until retrieval.  This is particularly important \nif the material or waste is chemically reactive, degrading or could leak to the \nenvironment. \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\nReport : NS-TAST-GD-24 Revision 6 \nCM9 Ref.:

RADIOACTIVE WASTE DEFINITIONS \n\nHigher Activity Radioactive Waste (HAW) \n\n9.1 \n\n9.2 \n\n9.3 \n\n9.4 \n\nHigher Activity Waste comprises High Level Waste (HLW) (or heat generating waste), \nIntermediate Level Waste (ILW) and such Low Level Waste (LLW) as cannot be \ndisposed of at present. \n\nHigh Level Waste (HLW) \n\nHLW \u2013 radioactive waste that is sufficiently radioactive that the decay heat significantly \nincreases its temperature and the temperature of its surroundings [23]. \n\nTypical characteristics of HLW are thermal power above ~2 kW/m3.  The heat \ngenerated from such waste has to be taken into account when designing storage or \ndisposal facilities. \n\nIntermediate Level Waste (ILW) \n\nILW - radioactive waste with radioactivity levels exceeding the upper boundaries for \nLLW, but which does not require heating to be taken into account for the design of \nstorage or disposal facilities [23].  IAEA guidance is that ILW thermal power is below \n~2 kW/m3. \n\nLow Level Waste (LLW) \n\n9.5 \n\nLLW is defined [33] as: \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\u201cradioactive waste having a radioactive content not exceeding four giga-\nbecquerels per tonne (GBq/te) of alpha or 12 GBq/te of beta/gamma activity.\u201d \n\n9.6 \n\nThe lower activity limit for LLW, below which waste is not required to be subject to \nspecific regulatory control is defined as \u2018out of scope\u2019 in the environmental permitting \nregulations: \n\nFor England and Wales: EPR16, Schedule 23, Part 2 and Part 3 [12] \n\nFor Scotland: EASR18, Schedule 8, Part 1 and Part 6 [17]. \n\nVery Low Level Waste (VLLW; a sub-category of LLW) \n\n9.7 \n\nVLLW is a sub-category of LLW; however amendments to legislation in 2011 means \nthat this sub-category is now obsolete.  Notwithstanding this, the term continues to be \nused in nuclear policy and guidance documents, as well as some environmental \npermits for England and Wales.  The following definitions are taken from the UK \nStrategy for the Management of Solid LLW from the Nuclear Industry [34]. \n\nVLLW (Low Volume) \n\n9.8 \n\nLow volumes (\u2018dustbin loads\u2019) of \u201cradioactive waste which can be safely disposed of to \nan unspecified destination with municipal, commercial or industrial waste (\u201cdustbin\u201d \ndisposal) if: \n\neach 0.1 m3 of waste contains less than 400 kBq of total activity or single items \ncontain less than 40 kBq of total activity \n\nFor wastes containing carbon-14 or hydrogen-3 (tritium): \n\n\uf0b7 \n\n\uf0b7 \n\nin each 0.1 m3, the activity limit is 4,000 kBq for carbon-14 and \nhydrogen-3 (tritium) taken together; and \nfor any single item, the activity limit is 400 kBq for carbon-14 and \nhydrogen-3 (tritium) taken together. \n\nReport : NS-TAST-GD-24 Revision 6 \nCM9 Ref.: 2019/254780 \n\nPage 25 of 27 \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n\fOffice for Nuclear Regulation \n \n\n9.9 \n\n \n \nControls on disposal of this material, after removal from the premises where the \nwastes arose, are not necessary.\u201d \n\nVLLW (High Volume) \n\n9.10  For bulk disposals \u2013 High Volume VLLW \u2013 where: \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\u201cRadioactive waste with maximum concentrations of four megabecquerels per \ntonne (MBq/te); or \n\nfor waste containing hydrogen-3 (tritium), with maximum concentrations of \n40 MBq/te; \n\ncan be disposed of to specified landfill sites. \n\n9.11  Controls on disposal of this material, after removal from the premises where the \n\nwastes arose, will be necessary in a manner specified by the environment regulators.\u201d \n\nReport : NS-TAST-GD-24 Revision 6 \nCM9 Ref.: 2019/254780 \n\nPage 26 of 27 \n\n \n \n\n\fOffice for Nuclear Regulation \n \n\nAPPENDIX B \u2013 GENERAL PRINCIPLES FOR PASSIVE SAFETY \n\n9.12  The following is a list of general principles taken from the SAPs [1] that should be \n\nconsidered in proposals developed by licensees. \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\nThe radioactivity should be immobilised; \n\nThe wasteform and its container should be physically and chemically stable; \n\nEnergy should be removed from the wasteform; \n\nA multibarrier approach should be adopted in ensuring containment; \n\nThe wasteform and its container should be resistant to degradation; \n\nThe storage environment should avoid degradation that may render the waste \nunsuitable for long-term management or disposal; \n\nThe need for active safety systems to ensure safety should be minimised; \n\nThe need for monitoring and maintenance to ensure safety should be \nminimised; \n\nThe should be no need for prompt intervention to maintain the facility in a safe \ncondition; \n\nThe storage building should be resistant to foreseeable hazards; \n\nAccess should be provided for response to incidents; \n\nThe storage facility should be designed and operated so that individual \npackages can be inspected and retrieved within an appropriate period of time.  \nThis may include the need for reserve storage space; \n\nThe lifetime of the storage building should be appropriate for the storage period \nprior to disposal; \n\nAppropriate provisions should be made for dealing with any radioactive waste \nor its packaging that shows signs of unacceptable behaviour; \n\nThe package should be compatible with the long-term management strategy for \nthe waste, which may include the need for a further period of storage, or \ndisposal. \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\nReport : NS-TAST-GD-24 Revision 6 \nCM9 Ref.: 2019/254780 \n\nPage 27 of 27 \n\n\f", "nuclear construction sites cns-tast-gd-6.6.pdf\n Title of document \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\nOFFICIAL \n\nONR GUIDE \n\nNUCLEAR CONSTRUCTION SITES \n\nDocument Type: \n\nNuclear Security Technical Assessment Guide \n\nUnique Document ID and \nRevision No: \n\nCNS-TAST-GD-6.6 Revision 0 \n\nDate Issued: \n\nApproved by: \n\nMarch 2017 \n\nReview Date: \n\nMarch 2020 \n\nDavid Pascoe \n\nProfessional Lead \n\nRecord Reference: \n\nTRIM Folder 4.4.2.19076.

This document contains Fundamental Security \nPrinciples (FSyPs) that dutyholders must demonstrate have been fully taken into \naccount in developing their security arrangements to meet relevant legal obligations. \nThe security regime for meeting these principles is described in security plans \nprepared by the dutyholders, which are approved by ONR under the Nuclear Industries \nSecurity Regulations (NISR) 2003 (Reference 1).  \n\nThe term \u2018security plan\u2019 is used to cover all dutyholder submissions such as nuclear \nsite security plans, temporary security plans and transport security statements. NISR \nRegulation 22 dutyholders may also use the SyAPs as the basis for Cyber Security \nand Information Assurance documentation that helps them demonstrate ongoing legal \ncompliance for the protection of Sensitive Nuclear Information (SNI). The SyAPs are \nsupported by a suite of guides to assist ONR inspectors in their assessment and \ninspection work, and in making regulatory judgements and decisions.  This Technical \nAssessment Guidance (TAG) is such a guide. \n\n2. \n\nPURPOSE AND SCOPE \n\nThis TAG contains guidance to advise and inform ONR inspectors in the exercise of \ntheir regulatory judgement during intervention activities relating to assessment of \nphysical protection at nuclear construction sites.  It aims to provide general advice and \nguidance to ONR inspectors on how this aspect of security should be assessed. It \ndoes not set out how ONR regulates the dutyholder\u2019s arrangements.  It does not \nprescribe the detail or methodologies for dutyholders to follow to demonstrate they \nhave addressed the SyAPs. It is the dutyholders responsibility to determine and \ndescribe this detail within their submission and for ONR to assess whether the \narrangements are adequate.  \n\n3. \n\nRELATIONSHIP TO RELEVANT LEGISLATION \n\nThe term \u2018dutyholder\u2019 mentioned throughout this guide is used to define \u2018responsible \npersons\u2019 on civil nuclear licensed sites and other nuclear premises subject to security \nregulation, a \u2018developer\u2019 carrying out work on a nuclear construction site and approved \ncarriers, as defined in NISR. It is also used to refer to those holding SNI.  \n\nNISR defines a \u2018nuclear premises\u2019 and requires \u2018the responsible person\u2019 as defined to \nhave an approved security plan in accordance with Regulation 4. It further defines \napproved carriers and requires them to have an approved Transport Security \nStatement in accordance with Regulation 16. Persons to whom Regulation 22 applies \nare required to protect SNI. ONR considers Physical Protection Systems (PPS) to be \nan important component of a dutyholder\u2019s arrangements in demonstrating compliance \nwith relevant legislation.   \n\n4. \n\nRELATIONSHIP TO IAEA DOCUMENTATION AND GUIDANCE \n\n4.1 \n\nThe essential elements of a national nuclear security regime are set out in the \nConvention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material (CPPNM) (Reference 4) and \nthe IAEA Nuclear Security Fundamentals (Reference 3). Further guidance is available \nwithin IAEA Technical Guidance and Implementing Guides. \n\n \n \nOFFICIAL  \n \n \n\nReport CNS-TAST-GD-6.6 \nTRIM Ref: 2017/106085 \n\nPage 2 of 17 \n\n\fOffice for Nuclear Regulation  \n \n \n\nOFFICIAL  \n \n \n\n4.3 \n\n4.4 \n\n5.1 \n\n5.2 \n\n4.2 \n\nFundamental Principle C of the CPPNM refers to the legislative and regulatory \nframework should provide for the establishment of applicable physical protection \nrequirements and include a system of evaluation and licensing or other procedures to \ngrant authorisation. The importance of issues relating to authorisation reiterated in the \nNuclear Security Fundamentals, specifically: \n\n\uf0b7 \n\nEssential Element 3: Legislative and Regulatory Framework \u2013 3.3 The \nlegislative and regulatory framework, and associated administrative \nmeasures, to govern the nuclear security regime provides for the \nestablishment of nuclear security regulations and requirements, and \nassociated procedures for evaluating applications and granting \nauthorisations or licences.  \n\nA more detailed description of issues relating to legislative and regulatory frameworks \nis provided in Recommendations level guidance, specifically paragraphs 3.8 to 3.17 of \nNuclear Security Series (NSS) 13, Recommendations on Physical Protection of \nNuclear Material and Nuclear Facilities (INFCIRC/225/Revision 5) (Reference 2). This \ndocument recommends that the State should licence activities or grant authorisation \nonly when such activities comply with its physical protection regulations.  \n\nThe IAEA also publish Implementing Guide NSS No. 19 \u2018Establishing the Nuclear \nSecurity Infrastructure for a Nuclear Power Programme\u2019 (Reference 8) where further \nrelevant information can be found on legislative and regulatory frameworks at \nparagraphs 3.1 to 3.12.  \n\n5. \n\nRELATIONSHIP TO NATIONAL POLICY DOCUMENTS \n\nThe SyAPs provide ONR inspectors with a framework for making consistent regulatory \njudgements on the effectiveness of a dutyholder\u2019s security arrangements.  This TAG \nprovides guidance to ONR inspectors when assessing a dutyholder\u2019s submission \ndemonstrating they have effective processes in place to achieve SyDP 6.6 \u2013 Nuclear \nConstruction Sites, in support of FSyP 6 \u2013 Physical Protection Systems.  The TAG is \nconsistent with other TAGs and associated guidance and policy documentation. \n\nThe HMG Security Policy Framework (SPF) (Reference 5) describes the Cabinet \nSecretary\u2019s expectations of how HMG organisations and third parties handling HMG \ninformation and other assets will apply protective security to ensure HMG can function \neffectively, efficiently and securely. The security outcomes and requirements detailed \nin the SPF have been incorporated within the SyAPs. This ensures that dutyholders \nare presented with a coherent set of expectations for the protection of nuclear \npremises, SNI and the employment of appropriate personnel security controls both on \nand off nuclear premises. \n\n5.3 \n\nThe Classification Policy (Reference 6) indicates those categories of SNI, which \nrequire protection and the level of security classification to be applied. \n\n6. \n\nDEFINITION OF A NUCLEAR CONSTRUCTION SITE \n\n6.1 \n\nSection 77 of the Anti-Terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001 (Reference 9), defines \nthe term \u2018Nuclear Construction Site\u2019 as a site on which works are being carried out with \na view to it becoming a nuclear site wholly or mainly for purposes other than defence \npurposes, which is situated within 5 kilometres of an existing nuclear site.  NISR 2003 \n\n \n \nOFFICIAL  \n \n \n\nReport CNS-TAST-GD-6.6 \nTRIM Ref: 2017/106085 \n\nPage 3 of 17 \n\n\fOffice for Nuclear Regulation  \n \n \n\nOFFICIAL  \n \n \n\nfurther defines a \u2018Nuclear Construction Site\u2019 as one which works are being carried out \nby a developer pursuant to the grant or issue of a planning or development consent \norder.  \n\n7. \n\nADVICE TO INSPECTORS \n\n7.1 \n\nNuclear construction sites present unique challenges to security, not least the scale of \nsome projects, extent of activity and numbers of personnel involved. All SyAPs and \ntheir associated TAGs will be relevant to nuclear construction site security at some \nstage and this TAG does not intend to reproduce the content of those TAGs.  The aim \nof this TAG is to highlight to inspectors the differences a construction site has to an \noperational site to allow for proportionate assessment.  It is a key principle that security \nmeasures are effective and proportionate to the threat, and inspectors should \nrecognise that dutyholders need flexibility to manage changes to the construction \nprocess.  Inspectors should be open to innovative proposals whilst ensuring risks are \nappropriately mitigated.     \n\n7.2 \n\nThe following list of TAGs whilst not exhaustive, are particularly relevant to this TAG: \n\nGovernance and Leadership \n\nMaintenance of a Robust Security Culture \n\nCommissioning of Security Systems \n\nOversight of Suppliers of Items of Services of nuclear Security \n\nCategorisation for Theft \n\nCategorisation for Sabotage \n\nPhysical Protection Design \n\nAdjacent and Enclave Sites \n\nGuidance on the Purpose, Scope and Quality of a Nuclear Site Security Plan \n\n7.3 \n\nThe purpose of the assessment is to determine whether the security arrangements on \na Nuclear Construction Site are adequate to address three specific risks: \n\nThe threat a Construction Site may pose to a neighbouring nuclear site \n\nThe threat a Construction Site may pose to an existing operating nuclear site \nwhere a facility is being constructed \n\nThe risk of sabotage through introducing defects into the new nuclear facility \nwhile it is under construction that could compromise the safety or security of \nthe nuclear facility once it starts operations \n\nThe assessment should also provide a level of confidence that the facility is being \nconstructed to meet the arrangements that will be detailed in the security plan once the \nfacility becomes operational using \u2018secure by design\u2019 principles.   \n\nThis document is not intended to provide guidance on the detailed design of security \narrangements for the operating facility. It is produced to highlight areas for assessment \nconsideration throughout the construction phase. \n\n7.4 \n\n7.5 \n\n \n\n \n \nOFFICIAL  \n \n \n\nReport CNS-TAST-GD-6.6 \nTRIM Ref: 2017/106085 \n\nPage 4 of 17 \n\n\uf0b7 \n\n\uf0b7 \n\n\uf0b7 \n\n\uf0b7 \n\n\uf0b7 \n\n\uf0b7 \n\n\uf0b7 \n\n\uf0b7 \n\n\uf0b7 \n\n\uf0b7 \n\n\uf0b7 \n\n\uf0b7 \n\n\fOffice for Nuclear Regulation  \n \n \n\nOFFICIAL  \n \n \n\nRegulatory Expectation \n\n7.6 \n\nThe regulatory expectation is that dutyholders demonstrate within their security plan \nhow their physical protection system is phased according to sensitivity of the site as \nconstruction develops in order to provide ongoing assurance that its activities cannot \nbe exploited by an adversary.  \n\nFSyP 6 \u2013 Physical \nProtection System \n\nNuclear Construction Sites \n\nSyDP 6.6 \n\nDutyholders should ensure that they implement a physical protection system designed \nto ensure its activities cannot be exploited by an adversary to incorporate a latent \ndefect or to pose a threat to an adjacent site.  \n\n \n\n8.1 \n\n8. \n\nNUCLEAR CONSTRUCTION SITES \u2013 GENERAL \n\nPhased Approach \n\nIn order to provide for effective and proportionate security arrangements throughout \nthe lifetime of the construction project, it is important that a phased approach is \nadopted.  The phases should identify key points during the construction process when \nit is necessary to make incremental security enhancements to reflect the rise in the \nlevel of risk as the project progresses. Each phase should be documented in the \nConstruction Site Security Plan (CSSP) together with the associated security \narrangements clearly articulated.  Security \u2018hold points\u2019 should be identified before \nprogressing from one phase to the next to provide time to assess and/or approve \namended or new versions of the security plan, and allow time for those revised \narrangements to become embedded and operational with proven reliability prior to an \nincrease in site sensitivity or categorisation. Examples of phases will be dependent on \nthe function of the new facility, but may include:  \n\nGround Investigations. \n\nPreparatory Groundworks.   \n\nFirst Nuclear Concrete. \n\n\uf0b7 \n\n\uf0b7 \n\n\uf0b7 \n\n\uf0b7 \n\n\uf0b7 \n\nIntroduction of Nuclear or Other Radioactive Material. \n\nFirst Criticality. \n\n8.2 \n\n8.3 \n\nConsideration should also be given to the proportionate arrangements for Temporary \nSecurity Plans (TSPs) during the transitional period without them placing an \nunnecessary burden on both dutyholder and regulator. This may be achieved by \ndefining in the security plan the type of activity and bounding cases where TSPs are \nrequired. \n\nCoordination with Licence Application and Licence Grant \n\nThe ONR publication \u2018Licensing Nuclear Installations\u2019 requires appropriate measures \nto be in place to manage all aspects of security before a site licence is granted.  \nInspectors will be required to assess the security measures in place and confirm they \nare appropriate.

The approval in principle of the security plan prior to Site Licence Grant \ncan be regarded as acceptance that ONR is satisfied with the security arrangements in \nplace and a Site Licence can be granted. \n\n8.4 \n\nThe submission must include detail of the security architecture for end state \noperations. This provides assurance to ONR that there is a defined end state for the \nsecurity regime and allows ONR to check that progress during the transitional period \naligns with regulatory expectations and in accordance with agreed timescale. Changes \nto the end state security architecture will require submission of an amended or new \nissue of the plan for approval. \n\nInspectors should consider: \n\n\uf0b7 \n\n\uf0b7 \n\n\uf0b7 \n\n\uf0b7 \n\nIs the security phased in its approach to reflect the level of risk as the project \nprogresses? \n\nAre there appropriate hold points identified between the phases? \n\nAre there appropriate provisions in place for engagement with the regulator \nto support achieving approval in principle of the security plan? \n\nDoes the security plan include detail of the security architecture for site end \nstate operations? \n\n9. \n\nSECURITY ARRANGEMENTS FOR A NUCLEAR CONSTRUCTION SITE \n\n9.1 \n\nAn approved security plan must be in place before a developer undertakes activities on \na nuclear construction site to construct a new nuclear facility and for which Planning or \nDevelopment Consent has been granted.  The security plan for the construction phase \nshould reflect the arrangements listed below. \n\nSecurity Appointments \n \n9.2 \n\nA Company Security Manager should be appointed at the early stages of the project to \ndevelop security arrangements and author the security plan.  A member of the \ndutyholder\u2019s senior management team should be appointed to oversee the overall \ndelivery of security.   \n\n9.3 \n\n9.4 \n\nA Site Security Manager or a Suitably Qualified and Experienced (SQEP) senior site \nmanager should be appointed to act as a security focal point for liaison with the \nadjacent site and to oversee security force activity.  \n\nOnce appointed, the Construction Site Director should have clear sight of security \nmeasures being adopted, a clear understanding of the risks and have clear \nresponsibilities for security governance. \n\nLiaison with Adjacent Site \n \n9.5 \n\nArrangements must be in place between the Security Manager and the adjacent \nnuclear site\u2019s security manager to ensure there is a flow of information including \nactivity on site, any potential hazards and reporting of security incidents for more \ninformation.  \n\n \n \nOFFICIAL  \n \n \n\nReport CNS-TAST-GD-6.6 \nTRIM Ref: 2017/106085 \n\nPage 6 of 17 \n\n\fOffice for Nuclear Regulation  \n \n \n\nOFFICIAL  \n \n \n\nIdentification of Vulnerabilities and Hazards \n \n9.6 \n\nUsing the NIMCA as a basis, an evaluation of the vulnerabilities and hazards should \nbe undertaken to ensure appropriate security arrangements are in place to mitigate the \nassociated risks of construction projects. Examples of vulnerabilities may include \nheavy plant/vehicles, explosives and charges (used in geotechnical surveys), \nscaffolding, ladders, heavy tools, fuel and chemicals, and large mounds of spoil and \nearth. Example mitigation measures are at Appendix A. \n\nAccess Control/Authorised Entry \n \n9.7 \n\nThe term Access Control is commonly used in relation to site or building access.  It is \nlikely that the initial stages of any development will be undertaken on open land where \nPublic Rights of Way (PROW) are still in place and there may be no defined perimeter.  \nIn such cases, access to controllable areas and buildings should be strictly managed \nto mitigate any vulnerabilities that the dutyholder has identified.   \n\n9.8 \n\n9.9 \n\nOnce PROW have been closed, a perimeter fence or barrier should be erected to \ndelineate the boundary of the Nuclear Construction Site. \n\nOnly authorised personnel and essential vehicles should be permitted access.  Non-\nessential vehicles should be parked off the construction site and away from any \nadjacent Nuclear Site or Facility. \n\nSecurity Control Point \n \n9.10  A Security Control Point should be established on the site at the designated \n\nvehicle/pedestrian access point.  It should be staffed by security personnel and used to \ncontrol and account for pedestrians/vehicles accessing and exiting from the \nconstruction site. This can act as a base from which security patrols are carried out \nand security documentation/records held. \n\nSearches \n \n9.11  A facility should be provided to carry out searches of personnel and vehicles to \n\nminimise the risk of the introduction of prohibited items. \n\nContractors Security Arrangements \n \n9.12  Contracts with third parties should clearly stipulate the security arrangements that are \n\nrequired.  Contractors are required to adhere to the same security arrangements as \nthe dutyholder\u2019s staff.  Arrangements involving the submission of security plans by \ncontactors to the dutyholder should be approved by the dutyholder\u2019s Security Manager \nand supported by comprehensive audit and assurance arrangements.  The use of such \nplans does not absolve the dutyholders from being responsible or accountable for \nsecurity, and statements to that effect should be clearly articulated in the security plan. \n\nPersonnel Security \n \n9.13  Large scale construction projects present unique challenges for dutyholders due to the \n\nlarge workforce on site, the majority of whom will probably be contractors and sub-\ncontractors, both long term and transient, employing a mixture of backgrounds and \n\n \n \nOFFICIAL  \n \n \n\nReport CNS-TAST-GD-6.6 \nTRIM Ref: 2017/106085 \n\nPage 7 of 17 \n\n\fOffice for Nuclear Regulation  \n \n \n\nOFFICIAL  \n \n \n\nnationalities.  The level of vetting checks required for staff, contractors and visitors on \na Nuclear Construction Site will depend on access requirements (e.g. to SNI, site plans \nand construction plant) and their roles, such as security and senior management \npositions.  FSyP 8 requires dutyholders to deliver the appropriate combination of \nrecruitment checks and vetting to satisfy themselves of the honesty and integrity of \npotential employees. \n\n9.14  The dutyholder must have a clear personnel security strategy which reflects the \n\nphased approach where security arrangements are commensurate with the level of \nrisk as the project progresses.  Use of zones or compounds should be considered \nwhere access should be limited to those personnel with higher levels of vetting/security \nclearance.   \n\nSecurity Culture \n\n9.15  There may be particular challenges to fostering a good security culture amongst \n\nworkers on a construction site due to the large numbers of people involved, the often \ntransient nature of contractors and the limited exposure many will have had to nuclear \nsecurity. The dutyholder should consider implementing a robust nuclear security \nculture from project start or implement a phased approach as the site develops. \n\nInspectors should consider: \n\n\uf0b7 \n\n\uf0b7 \n\n\uf0b7 \n\n\uf0b7 \n\n\uf0b7 \n\n\uf0b7 \n\n\uf0b7 \n\n\uf0b7 \n\n\uf0b7 \n\nIs there a company security manager and a member of the senior \nmanagement team appointed to oversee the delivery of security? \n\nIs there a Site Security Manager or SQEP senior manager appointed to act \nas the security focal point for liaison with the adjacent site and to oversee \nsecurity force activity? \n\nDoes the Construction Site Manager have a clear understanding of the risks \nand have clear responsibilities for security governance? \n\nAre there effective liaison arrangements in place with any adjacent nuclear \npremises? \n\nHas NIMCA been used as a basis for an evaluation of the vulnerabilities and \nhazards to ensure appropriate security arrangements are in place to mitigate \nthe associated risks of construction projects? \n\nAre access control arrangements effective, incorporating a security control \npoint and searching? \n\nIs there adequate control of the supply chain?  \n\nIs there a clear and effective personnel security strategy? \n\nIs there an effective strategy in place to foster a strong security culture? \n\n10. \n\nLICENSED NUCLEAR SITE UNDER CONSTRUCTION \n\n10.1  The term \u2018Licensed Nuclear Site Under Construction\u2019 is used to describe a new site on \n\nwhich construction activity is being carried out, from the point at which a Nuclear Site \n\n \n \nOFFICIAL  \n \n \n\nReport CNS-TAST-GD-6.6 \nTRIM Ref: 2017/106085 \n\nPage 8 of 17 \n\n\fOffice for Nuclear Regulation  \n \n \n\nOFFICIAL  \n \n \n\nLicence is granted up to the time that the site is to become operational. A Licensed \nNuclear Site Under Construction must have an approved NSSP in place.  The NSSP is \nto build on the measures already detailed in the CSSP to address the threat to and \nfrom a neighbouring operating nuclear site.  It is also required to address the risk of \nsabotage through maliciously introducing defects into the nuclear facility while it is \nbeing constructed that could compromise safety or security once operations start. \n\n10.2  The dutyholder should submit a draft NSSP at licence application and engage with \n\nONR inspectors during its development.  The NSSP should reflect the phased \napproach to security arrangements throughout the project as described in para 8.1 \nabove.  The approval in principle of the NSSP prior to Site Licence Grant can be \nregarded as acceptance that ONR is satisfied with the security arrangements in place. \nThe NSSP should also outline end state security requirements. These are the security \nstandards, procedures and arrangements, including the location of buildings and \nbarriers that must be in place before the site is formally categorised to the highest \ncategory for the prevention of theft or sabotage (refer to the PPS outcomes).   \n\nIntroduction of defects \n \n10.3  The dutyholder should clearly identify the point at which the site is sufficiently \n\ndeveloped to be vulnerable to the introduction of defects which may compromise the \nsafety or security of the facility once it starts operating.  Vulnerabilities should be \nclearly identified and appropriate security arrangements put in place to mitigate the \nrisks.  \n\nIntroduction of Nuclear or Other Radioactive Material \n \n10.4  As the project progresses there may be a requirement to introduce Nuclear Material \n\n(NM) and Other Radioactive Material (ORM) such as radioactive sources and new \nnuclear fuel before the facility becomes operational.  The security arrangements to \nprotect this material must achieve the required PPS outcome as detailed in the PPS \nOutcome Definition Table.  \n\nSite Boundary \n \n10.5  A permanent fence should be in place which delineates the site boundary and \n\nexcludes any public rights of way. \n\nSerious Organised Crime and Police Act (SOCPA)  \n \n10.6  Once a Licence has been granted the site becomes a \u2018designated site\u2019 subject to the \nSerious Organised Crime and Police Act (SOCPA) 2005 s128 (Reference 10). \nDutyholders are to demonstrate that enforcement of SOCPA can be implemented \nwhenever necessary (e.g. the provision of a defined boundary, access control and \nclear signage). \n\nInspectors should consider: \n\n\uf0b7 \n\n\uf0b7 \n\nDoes the security plan adopt the phased approach? \n\nDoes the security plan outline the end-state security arrangements? \n\n \n \nOFFICIAL  \n \n \n\nReport CNS-TAST-GD-6.6 \nTRIM Ref: 2017/106085 \n\nPage 9 of 17 \n\n\fOffice for Nuclear Regulation  \n \n \n\nOFFICIAL  \n \n \n\n\uf0b7 \n\n\uf0b7 \n\n\uf0b7 \n\nDoes the security plan identify the point at which the site is sufficiently \ndeveloped to be vulnerable to the introduction of defects which may \ncompromise the safety or security of the facility once it starts operating? \n\nDoes the security plan demonstrate the required security outcome is \nachieved at all stages of project development, particularly as NM and ORM \nis brought on and the categorisation for theft and sabotage increases? \n\nIs there an appropriate site boundary in place that allows in enforcement of \nSOCPA once the licence is granted? \n\n11.  MULTIPLE UNIT SITES \n\n11.1  New Nuclear Power Stations may consist of two or more operating reactors in close \nproximity to one another.  The timeframe for operations may mean one or more units \noperating whilst others are still under construction.  Security arrangements during this \nperiod must still achieve the appropriate PPS outcome for the operating reactor(s).  \nInspectors should be flexible and engage with dutyholders to ensure that security \narrangements, some of which may be temporary, continue to achieve the appropriate \nPPS outcome. \n\n \n\n \n \nOFFICIAL  \n \n \n\nReport CNS-TAST-GD-6.6 \nTRIM Ref: 2017/106085 \n\nPage 10 of 17 \n\n\fOffice for Nuclear Regulation  \n \n \n\nREFERENCES \n\nOFFICIAL  \n \n \n\n \n12. \n\n1. \n\n \n2. \n\n \n3. \n\n \n4. \n\n \n5. \n\n \n6. \n \n7. \n \n8. \n\n \n9. \n\n \n10. \n\n \n \n \n\nNuclear Industries Security Regulations 2003.

The principles presented in these SAPs are \nsupported by a suite of guides to further assist ONR\u2019s inspectors in their technical \nassessment work in support of making regulatory judgments and decisions.  This \ntechnical assessment guide is one of those guides. \n\n2. \n\nPURPOSE AND SCOPE \n\nThe purpose of this Technical Assessment Guide (TAG) is to assist in making informed \njudgements and decisions on the adequacy of the licensee\u2019s arrangements and their \nimplementation, to ensure that changes to organisational structure or resources which \nmay affect safety are adequately controlled in accordance with the requirement of \nnuclear site licence condition (LC) 36 \u2018Organisational Capability\u2019 as set out in Appendix  \n\nAppendix 4 of this TAG also provides guidance on how Inspectors should approach \nthe revised clause in LC 36(1), added in 2011, which requires licensees to provide and \nmaintain adequate financial and human resources to fulfil their obligations in respect of \nnuclear safety.  The revised LC 36(1) was introduced, together with amendments to LC \n17 \u2018Management Systems\u2019, to ensure that the Nuclear Safety Directive \n2009/71/Euratom (NSD) is fully implemented in Great Britain.  \n\nIt incorporates guidance for inspectors in judging the adequacy with which licensees\u2019 \narrangements have been implemented, originally presented in T/INS/036 \u2018LC36 \nControl of Organisational Change\u2019, thus consolidating related guidance within this \nsingle reference document.  Factors that the inspector may wish to consider \nconcerning the way in which a licensee\u2019s arrangements are implemented are set out in \nAppendix 5.   \n\nONR guidance on assessing arrangements to provide and maintain adequate human \nresources is presented in NS-TAST-GD-065 \u2018Function and Content of the Nuclear \nBaseline\u2019. Together, these guides provide comprehensive advice to inspectors on the \nrequirements of LC36, as such they should be considered in combination when judging \nthe adequacy of a licensee\u2019s arrangements for LC36.  The nuclear industry Safety \nDirectors\u2019 Forum (nuclearinst.com/Safety-Directors-Forum) has also published a Good \nPractice Guide (GPG) \u2018Nuclear Baseline and the Management of Organisational \nChange \u2013 A Good Practice Guide\u2019, with the cooperation of ONR.  This guidance should \nbe considered as relevant good practice and inspectors should encourage licensees to \nbe familiar with it, and use it, where appropriate.  Where licensees are able to \ndemonstrate that their arrangements are consistent with the guidance in the GPG, \ninspectors should regard this as meeting the expectations of this TAG and sufficient for \ncompliance with LC 36(2) and LC 36(5). \n\n1.1 \n\n2.1 \n\n2.2 \n\n2.3 \n\n2.4 \n\n \n3. \n\nRELATIONSHIP TO LICENCE AND OTHER RELEVANT LEGISLATION \n\nThe following UK legal and other requirements are applicable to this TAG: \n\n3.1 \n\nThe Management of Health and Safety at Work Regulations \n\n\uf06e \n\nregulations  describe  employers\u2019 \n\nThese \nthe \nrequirements  for  control  and  co-operation  with  outside  undertakings,  together \nwith  appropriate  arrangements  for  effective  planning,  organisation,  control, \nmonitoring and review.  In particular, Regulation 13 requires employers to take \ninto  account  employees\u2019  capabilities  as  regards  health  and  safety  when \nentrusting tasks to employees.  \n\nresponsibilities,  addressing \n\nReport : NS-TAST-GD-048 Revision 5 \nTRIM Ref: 2018/283567 \n\nPage 2 of 25 \n\n \n \n\n\fOffice for Nuclear Regulation  \n \n \n\n3.2 \n\nNuclear Site Licence Conditions  \n\nThe following site licence conditions are of particular relevance to this TAG: \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\nLC  6  \u2013  Documents,  Records,  Authorities  and  Certificates.  The  licensee \nshall  make  adequate  records  to  demonstrate  compliance  with  any  of  the \nconditions attached to the nuclear site licence.  The licensee\u2019s management of \nchange  arrangements  should  include  provision  for  the  identification  and \nmanagement of records arising from implementation of the arrangements. \n\nLC12  \u2013  Duly  Authorised  and  Other  Suitably  Qualified  and  Experienced \nPersons.  The  licensee  shall  make  and  implement  adequate  arrangements  to \nensure that only suitably qualified and experienced persons perform any duties \nwhich  may  affect  the  safety  of  operations  on  the  site.    Persons  fulfilling \nmanagement  of  organisational  change  roles,  as  roles  which  may  affect  the \nsafety  of  operations,  must  be  suitably  qualified  and  experienced  to  fulfil  those \nroles. \n\nLC  17  \u2013  Management  Systems.  The  licensee  shall  establish  and  implement \nadequate  quality  management  arrangements  in  respect  of  all  matters  which \nmay affect safety. Management of change arrangements should be an integral \npart of the licensee\u2019s management system. \n\nLC  26  \u2013  Control  and  Supervision  of  Operations.  The  licensee  shall  ensure \nthat  no  operations  are  carried  out  which  may  affect  safety  except  under  the \ncontrol and supervision of suitably qualified and experienced persons appointed \nfor  that  purpose  by  the  licensee.    Persons  fulfilling  management  of  change \nroles, as roles which may affect the safety of operations, should be SQEP. \n\nLC 36 \u2013 Organisational Capability.  The licensee shall provide and maintain \nadequate  financial  and  human  resources  to  ensure  the  safe  operation  of  the \nlicensed site, and make and implement arrangements to control any change to \nits organisational structure or resources which may affect safety. \n\nRELATIONSHIP TO SAPS, WENRA REFERENCE LEVELS AND IAEA SAFETY \nSTANDARDS ADDRESSED \n\nSafety Assessment Principles \n\nThe Safety Assessment Principles for Nuclear Facilities (2014 Edition, Revision 0) \nprovide a framework to guide regulatory decision making in the nuclear permissioning \nprocess.

Identifies  the  need  for  oversight  of  nuclear  safety \n\nperformance and a Management System. \n\n\uf06e  MS.2  \u2013  Capable  Organisation.  Identifies  the  need  for  changes  to  the \norganisation to be systematically evaluated to ensure that they do not adversely \naffect nuclear safety management capabilities. \n\n\uf06e  MS.3 \u2013 Decision Making. Identifies the need for decision making to be based on \nprocesses  that  ensure  the  conflict  between  nuclear  safety  and  other  business \ngoals,  including  commercial  and  schedule  pressures  and  external  influences, \nare recognised and resolved. \n\n\uf06e  MS.4  \u2013  Learning.

It defines the requirements for establishing, \nassessing, sustaining and continuously improving leadership and management for \nsafety in organisations.  Requirement 9 focuses on provision of resources and \nrequirement 12 focuses on fostering a culture for safety. \n\n4.5 \n\nGSR Part 2 requires that: \n\nProvision is made in the management system to identify any changes (including \norganisational  changes)  that  could  have  significant  implications  for  safety  and \nto ensure that they are appropriately analysed; and \n\nPlanned  reviews  of  the  management  system  take  account  of  changes  in  the \norganisation. \n\n4.6 \n\nThe following reports produced by IAEA are also directly relevant: \n\nINSAG  18  \u2013  Managing  Change  in  the  Nuclear  Industry:  The  Effects  on \nSafety.    This  report  discusses  how  and  why  change  can  challenge  the \nmaintenance  of  high  levels  of  safety,  and  what  can  be  done  to  control  that \nchallenge and reap all the benefits of change. \n\nIAEA Safety Guide GS-G-3.1 and GS-G-3.5 \u2013 Application of the \nManagement System for Facilities and Activities and The Management \nSystem for Nuclear Installations  \n\nThese documents provide generic guidance to aid in establishing, \nimplementing, assessing and continually improving a management system. \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n \n5. \n\n5.1 \n\n5.2 \n\n5.3 \n\n5.4 \n\nADVICE TO INSPECTORS \n\nBackground  \n\nLC 36(1), which was introduced by a variation to all extant nuclear site licences in July \n2011, requires the licensee to provide and maintain adequate financial and human \nresources. \n\nAppendix 4 provides guidance to inspectors on the approach that should be taken to \nassessing the financial resources aspects of this requirement.  However, when this \nvariation was introduced, ONR advised that it considered that existing licensees would \nalready comply with the requirement to provide and maintain adequate human \nresources, by virtue of their Nuclear Baseline. \n\nNS-TAST-GD-065 \u2018Function and Content of a Nuclear Baseline\u2019 sets out ONR\u2019s \nexpectations that a licensee should have a nuclear baseline to provide a \ndemonstration that it has suitable and sufficient organisational structures, staffing and \ncompetences in place to effectively and reliably carry out those activities which \ncould impact on nuclear safety. \n\nNS-TAST-GD-065, supplemented by other guidance such as NS-TAST-GD-027 \n\u2018Training and Assuring Personnel Competence\u2019, is therefore instrumental in setting out \nONR\u2019s expectations of the way in which a licensee shows that it has, and maintains, \nadequate human resources.  The nuclear baseline also provides a clear description of \nthe currently intended staffing levels as a reference point or \u2018baseline\u2019 against which \n\nReport : NS-TAST-GD-048 Revision 5 \nTRIM Ref: 2018/283567 \n\nPage 5 of 25 \n\n \n \n\n\fOffice for Nuclear Regulation  \n \n \n\n5.5 \n\n5.6 \n\n5.7 \n\n5.8 \n\n5.9 \n\n5.10 \n\n5.11 \n\nthe licensee can assess the potential impact on nuclear safety of proposed \norganisational changes, noting that it will also be affected by changes in business \nobjectives such as lifetime extensions. \n\nLC 36(2) requires the licensee to make and implement adequate arrangements to \ncontrol any change to its organisational structure or resources which may affect safety.  \nAppendix 1 states the licence condition in full.  ONR interprets this condition to relate \nspecifically to nuclear safety although licensees may wish to apply similar \narrangements to manage changes affecting industrial safety, security, environmental \nmatters or other parts of their business. \n\nThe licensee\u2019s management of change arrangements should ensure that the nuclear \nsafety implications of a proposed change are fully considered and that risks arising \nfrom inadequate assessment and implementation of the change are recognised and \nsuitably controlled.  These arrangements should be part of a licensee\u2019s management \nsystem. \n\nThere are many drivers for organisational change and, without formal change \nmanagement, a licensee may not immediately recognise the implications of a \nproposed course of action.  Examples of drivers for organisational change and their \npotential implications are given in Appendix 2. \n\nIt is important that the full implications of a proposed change or a series of changes are \nassessed prior to implementation of the change(s).  This is to guard against a failure to \nconsider all relevant factors and potential dependencies between related changes, and \nthe potential for 'salami slicing' in which a major change is decomposed into a series of \nlesser changes which are treated independently.  This applies to changes at all levels \nin the organisation including the very top of the organisation i.e. the Board or Executive \nteam, where changes in the composition and knowledge of either of these teams can \nhave a potentially significant influence over nuclear safety. \n\nChanges should be classified according to nuclear safety significance. Broad guidance \nfor inspectors on the classification of organisational changes is given in Appendix 3.  \nThe level of assessment required should be proportionate to the potential nuclear \nsafety significance of the change. \n\nIt should be noted that replacing one post holder with another post holder on a like-for-\nlike basis need not constitute a trigger for the application of management of change \narrangements as this should ordinarily be addressed through the licensee\u2019s \narrangements made under LC 12.  However, where a number of changes are to be \nundertaken in the same area or there is a consequential effect on roles and \nresponsibilities, the arrangements should be applied.  \n\nIn addition to this TAG and NS-TAST-GD-065, inspectors should be familiar with the \nnuclear industry GPG on \u2018Nuclear Baseline and the Management of Organisational \nChange.  This guidance was produced, and is maintained, by an industry working \ngroup that includes ONR.  Where licensees are able to demonstrate that their \narrangements are consistent with the guidance in the GPG, inspectors should regard \nthis as meeting the expectations of this TAG and sufficient for compliance with the \nLicence Condition.  The GPG is available on the website of the Safety Director\u2019s \nForum (nuclearinst.com/Safety-Directors-Forum). \n\n5.12  For new build organisations, it is important that management of change arrangements \nare fully developed and implemented in sufficient time to allow an adequate period of \ndemonstrated working, usually in the region of 12 months prior to the Nuclear Site \nLicensing (NSL) decision. It is recognised that new build organisations develop rapidly \nduring the pre-application and early NSL assessment phase of the project. However, \nimplementation of these arrangements should enable an organisation to establish and \n\nReport : NS-TAST-GD-048 Revision 5 \nTRIM Ref: 2018/283567 \n\nPage 6 of 25 \n\n \n \n\n\fOffice for Nuclear Regulation  \n \n \n\ndemonstrate the appropriate level of control, while supporting the development of the \ncompany\u2019s resourcing strategy. This should enabling ONR to gain confidence in the \ncompany\u2019s approach to building a nuclear competent organisation.   \n\n5.13  ONR recognises that, unlike mature licensee organisations, a new build organisation \n\nmay not be \u2018right first time\u2019 and will continue to evolve, particularly during the early \nstages of a new build project.  The organisation should ensure that its management of \nchange arrangements are proportionate to the phase of the project and sufficiently \nflexible to enable rather than constrain organisational development. \n\n5.14  ONR acknowledges that for low hazard sites, typically those below the REPPIR \n\nthreshold, it may be proportionate for a simplified management of change process to \nbe applied.  It is however still important that an adequate risk assessment is \nundertaken for organisational changes on these lower hazard sites to ensure the \norganisational capability is suitable to manage nuclear safety.  It is particularly \nimportant that a proportionate process allowing flexibility is developed to manage staff \nreduction prior to entry of a site into care and maintenance.  \n\nONR Permissioning of Organisational Change  \n\n5.15  To introduce flexibility into the permissioning process, licensees may prescribe, with \n\nONR agreement \u2018derived\u2019 powers for use by ONR usually but not exclusively when \npermissioning the highest category of change proposal. The \u2018derived\u2019 powers defined \nin a licensee\u2019s LC 36 arrangements may include agreement, notification, \nacknowledgement and specification but not approval, consent or direction. However, \nderived powers have no formal legal basis and constitute administrative arrangements \nagreed between ONR and the licensee. Inspectors should note that inclusion of \nderived powers are not a prerequisite for the licensee\u2019s LC 36 arrangements to be \nconsidered as adequate, nor does their use preclude the use of primary powers to \nexercise regulatory control over modifications. This guidance provides advice to \ninspectors on ONR\u2019s expectations for adequate licensee arrangements required under \nLC36 (2).  \n\n5.16  The licensee\u2019s arrangements may also include provision for enhanced implementation \n\nmonitoring and control of a proposed organisational change by ONR, where ONR \nconsiders that the use of primary or derived power Licence Instruments may not be \nappropriate or proportionate to exercise regulatory control and oversight of a licensee\u2019s \nmodification proposal. Where this is the case, the inspector should check that such \narrangements are consistent with the expectations set out in NS-PER-GD-001 \nRevision 2. \n\n5.17  This guidance provides advice to inspectors on ONR\u2019s expectations for adequate \n\nlicensee arrangements required under LC36 (2). \n\nManagement of Change Principles \n\n5.18  There are some broad principles which underpin ONR\u2019s expectations of a licensee\u2019s \n\nmanagement of change arrangements.  These are set out below and then each \nprinciple is discussed in more detail in the following sections.  \n\n1. \n\n2. \n\nThe  arrangements  should  be  robust,  incorporated  as  part  of  the  licensee\u2019s \nmanagement  system  and  applied  to  all  activities  that  have  the  potential  to \nimpact on nuclear safety; \n\nThe Board of the licensee/Executive should own and support the management \nof  change  arrangements  and  ensure  that  they  are  embedded  throughout  the \norganisation; \n\nReport : NS-TAST-GD-048 Revision 5 \nTRIM Ref: 2018/283567 \n\nPage 7 of 25 \n\n \n \n\n\fOffice for Nuclear Regulation  \n \n \n\n3. \n\n4. \n\n5. \n\n6. \n\nThe arrangements should reference the nuclear baseline and include a process \nfor updating it on a regular basis; \n\nThe arrangements should include an initial screening assessment to identify the \npotential  safety  significance  of  a  change  proposal  and  establish  a  suitable \ncategorisation for determining the level of analysis, justification and challenge; \n\nThe  licensee  should  assess  and  justify  the  safety  of  a  proposed  change, \ncommensurate  with  its  unmitigated  potential  impact  on  safety  should  the \nchange be inadequately conceived or executed, identify and implement suitable \ncontrols  to  ensure  nuclear  safety  is  not  adversely  affected  and  monitor  the \nimplementation of the change.  \n\nThe  licensee  should  periodically  review  the  effectiveness  of  the  overall \narrangements and the changes that have been implemented. \n\nPrinciple 1  \n\nA \nlicensee\u2019s  management  of  change  arrangements  should  be  robust, \nincorporated as part of the management system and applied to all activities that \nhave the potential to impact on nuclear safety. \n\n5.19  The licensee should have formal, systematic arrangements in place to assess, monitor \nand review organisational changes to ensure that they are managed in a co-ordinated, \nconsistent and effective manner.  These arrangements should be owned and \nsupported by the licensee Board/Executive. \n\n5.20  These arrangements, which may under primary powers be approved by ONR, should \nbe part of the licensee\u2019s management system, and ideally be integrated with the \norganisation\u2019s HR processes rather than being separate and additional.  This also \nmeans that the resource implications of change can be considered as part of the \noverall management of the organisation and its capabilities. They should set out the \nroles and responsibilities for managing changes with clearly assigned responsibilities \nfor originating, peer review, approval, monitoring, close-out of individual changes and \npost change reviews.  \n\n5.21  The scope of the licensee\u2019s arrangements should include all organisational changes \n\nthat could potentially affect nuclear safety, not just roles and posts included in the \nnuclear baseline.  The licensee needs to be able to demonstrate through a \nproportionate application of its arrangements that it can influence or mitigate the \nimpact of such changes so that nuclear safety is not compromised. This may, for \nexample, include the impact on the licensee of proposed actions or decisions made by \nparent companies or Parent Body Organisations where these could impact on the \nlicensee\u2019s capability or its management of nuclear safety.  The licensee should also \nconsider the potential effects on culture and morale arising from the change. \n\n5.22  The scope of the arrangements should also include important enabling and support \nfunctions such as human resources, finance and procurement where these have the \npotential either directly, or through consequential change, to impact on the licensee\u2019s \nmanagement of nuclear safety. \n\n5.23  The arrangements should allow for use of the management of change process as a \n\nflexible risk assessment tool where appropriate.  Examples of when this might be \nnecessary include long-term absences and long-standing vacancies.  The default \nassumption should be that all posts and changes have the potential to affect safety \nmanagement unless it can be demonstrated otherwise.  \n\n5.24  Proposed changes should be assessed using a consistent methodology. The \n\nmethodology should be applied to all proposed changes in order to make and record \nan early judgement of the potential impact on nuclear safety.  ONR\u2019s expectations of a \nmethodology are set out in Principles 4 and 5. \n\n \n \n\nReport : NS-TAST-GD-048 Revision 5 \nTRIM Ref: 2018/283567 \n\nPage 8 of 25 \n\n\fOffice for Nuclear Regulation  \n \n \n\n5.25  Staff involved in ensuring or assuring the quality of management of change proposals \n\nshould be suitably qualified and experienced persons (SQEP) to do so and SQEP \nrequirements for staff fulfilling key roles within the arrangements should be clearly \ndefined.  The importance of SQEP input to a management of change assessment \ncannot be over emphasised as staff experienced in the management of change \nprocess can apply that experience and judgement to avoid the potential pitfalls that \nless experienced staff may not be aware of. \n\n5.26  Staff implementing LC36 arrangements should be given specific training in MOC \n\ntheory and principles as well as the licensee\u2019s arrangements.  They should not be \ndeemed to be competent on the basis of seniority. \n\n5.27  The arrangements should ensure that individual change proposals are clearly identified \n\nand that details of the change i.e. change category and other important attributes are \nrecorded in a change register.  Documentation used to assess, decide upon, monitor, \nreview and close-out the change should be retained for current and future reference in \naccordance with the licensee\u2019s arrangements under LC 6. \u2018Documents, Records, \nAuthorities and Certificates\u2019. \n\n5.28  The arrangements should consider and, where possible, allow for the reversibility of \n\nchanges or the application of contingency plans should subsequent performance \nmonitoring indicate that the change has been inappropriately conceived or \ninadequately implemented.  The extent of the reversibility may be related to the \nsignificance of the change and the availability of effective countermeasures. For larger, \nmore significant changes, consideration should also be given to the options for how the \nobjectives of the change can be achieved, including a justification of the chosen option.  \nThe development of a communications plan should also be considered. \n\n5.29  All change proposals should be subject to a proportionate level of scrutiny and \n\nchallenge, analogous to expectations for modifications to existing plant made under LC \n22 \u2018Modification or Experimentation on Existing Plant\u2019. The level of scrutiny is likely to \nincrease with potential significance.  Where the safety significance of a proposed \nchange is judged to be high, the arrangements should provide for seeking advice from \nthe NSC (or identified equivalent status body where appropriate), and senior \nmanagement oversight of the effectiveness of the process and implementation of \nindividual changes.  \n\n5.30  The licensee\u2019s arrangements should require approval to be formally granted by a \n\nSQEP prior to implementation of a change subject to satisfactory confirmation that any \nenabling actions have been completed, and for the change to be formally signed off on \ncompletion. \n\n5.31  The effectiveness of implementation of the arrangements should be routinely \n\nmonitored and reviewed as part of the licensee\u2019s normal assurance processes. \n\n5.32  The inspector should consider whether or not:  \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\nThe  licensee  has  formal,  documented  management  of  change  arrangements \nwhich are an integral part of its management system; \n\nIt is clear that the arrangements apply to all aspects of the licensee\u2019s activities, \nincluding changes at Board or Executive team level, that have the potential to \naffect  nuclear  safety,  and  have  they  been  promulgated  to  all  parts  of  the \nlicensee\u2019s organisation; \n\nThe  documented  arrangements  are  clear,  available  to  end  users  and  up  to \ndate; \n\n\uf06e \n\nThe arrangements use a methodology which is easy to understand and follow; \n\nReport : NS-TAST-GD-048 Revision 5 \nTRIM Ref: 2018/283567 \n\nPage 9 of 25 \n\n \n \n\n\fOffice for Nuclear Regulation  \n \n \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\nThe  methodology  is  being  consistently  interpreted  and  applied  across  the \nlicensee organisation; \n\nRoles  and  responsibilities  for  implementing  the  management  of  change \narrangements are clearly defined, integrated with the management system and \nunderstood by staff with management of change process roles; \n\nSQEP  requirements  for  staff  fulfilling  key  roles  within  the  arrangements  are \nclearly defined; \n\nStaff  fulfilling  key  management  of  change  arrangements  are  demonstrably \nSQEP  for  those  roles  and  they  have  a  suitable  level  of  authority  within  the \nlicensee\u2019s organisation; \n\nAll change proposals are logged in a change register and records are available \nto  substantiate  the  key  decisions  made  in  support  of  significant  changes  in \naccordance with the licensee\u2019s arrangements for LC 6; \n\nThe  arrangements  are  subject  to  the  processes  of  independent  review  and \naudit operated by the licensee. \n\nPrinciple 2  \n\nthe \nThe  Board  of \nmanagement  of  change  arrangements  and  ensure  that  they  are  embedded \nthroughout the organisation.  \n\nlicensee/Executive  should  own  and  support \n\nthe \n\n5.33  A licensee\u2019s management of change arrangements should be peer reviewed and \n\nimplemented consistently and effectively, and a visible commitment to these \narrangements should be made by the licensee Board/Executive.  The Board/Executive \nshould be able to show that it actively uses the MOC arrangements and supports the \nmanagement of change process by regularly reinforcing to the workforce the \nimportance of having and following a robust change process.  \n\n5.34  The Board/Executive should ensure that SQEP resources are put in place to develop \nthe management of change arrangements, to implement them and to maintain \noversight of the way in which the arrangements are used.  This should include \nprovision for suitable levels of challenge and independent peer review of change \nproposals as part of the licensee\u2019s corporate governance arrangements, and for \nseeking advice from the Nuclear Safety Committee or identified equivalent status body \nwhere appropriate.  \n\n5.35  The management of change arrangements should apply throughout the company, up \n\nto and including the Executive team and Board, noting that strategic and complex \nchanges to the structure or staff composition of a business may often originate at this \nlevel.  \n\n5.36  Progress with, and the effectiveness of, the implementation of significant, complex \n\nchanges should be regularly monitored by the Board/Executive. The Board/Executive \nshould establish an oversight process for this purpose as appropriate.  \n\n5.37 \n\nIt is expected that the licensee Board/Executive will proactively discuss significant, \ncomplex changes with ONR at an early stage.  This will allow the licensee to share its \nintentions with ONR and for ONR to provide advice and guidance as appropriate.  It \nwill also help ONR to understand the licensee\u2019s business drivers and to schedule and \nprioritise its own resources as appropriate.  \n\n5.38  The Board/Executive should satisfy itself that management of change arrangements \n\nare embedded throughout the organisation and that suitable provision is made to \nperiodically review the effectiveness of the arrangements, and to monitor the \ncumulative effects of changes on the overall health of the licensee organisation.

Individual change assessments should reference the baseline where the \nproposed change is likely to have an impact on it.  \n\n5.42  The baseline should be dynamic and updated as changes are made to the \n\norganisational structure and resources, and periodically reviewed to consolidate \nchanges.  \n\n5.43  The nuclear baseline should be used as an integral part of the licensees resourcing \n\nprocesses.  \n\n5.44  The inspector should consider whether or not:  \n\n\uf06e \n\nThe baseline is up to date and reflective of the licensee\u2019s current organisation;  \n\n\uf06e  Management  of  change  assessments  include  a  reference  to  the  nuclear \nbaseline  and  identify  whether  or  not  the  proposed  changes  affect  baseline \nroles;  \n\n\uf06e \n\nThe  nuclear  baseline  is  regularly  reviewed  to  ensure  that  it  is  up  to  date  and \nincorporates changes affecting baseline roles;  \n\nReport : NS-TAST-GD-048 Revision 5 \nTRIM Ref: 2018/283567 \n\nPage 11 of 25 \n\n \n \n\n\fOffice for Nuclear Regulation  \n \n \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\nThe  management  of  change  arrangements  take  account  of  the  cumulative \neffects of low category changes on the nuclear baseline;  \n\nThe  management  of  change  arrangements \nvulnerabilities when completing the risk assessment of the change; \n\ntake  account  of  baseline \n\nThe management of change arrangements are integrated with human resource \nprocesses;  \n\nThere  is  evidence  that  the  resource  implications  of  proposed  changes  are \nshared with human resources as part of the change assessment process;  \n\nResource actions arising from individual management of change assessments \nhave been closed and, if not, that unresolved actions are being managed.  \n\nPrinciple 4  \n\nA  licensee\u2019s  management  of  change  arrangements  should  include  an  initial \nscreening  assessment  to  identify  the  potential  safety  significance  of  a \nchange proposal and establish a suitable categorisation for determining the \nlevel of analysis, justification and challenge.  \n\n5.45 \n\nIt is important that a proposed change is assessed prior to implementation to ensure \nthat the implications of the change are fully understood.  The assessment can be \nconsidered as an organisational risk assessment which identifies the potential risks \nassociated with the proposed change, including risks arising both from the outcome of \na proposed change and the process of transition.  \n\n5.46  The licensee\u2019s management of change arrangements should include provision for an \n\ninitial screening assessment to identify the potential nuclear safety significance of a \nproposed change in the event that the change is inadequately conceived or executed.  \nThe output of this assessment should be used to inform the classification of the \nchange (as required by LC 36 (5)) which in turn is related to the level of analysis, \njustification and scrutiny that the licensee gives to the change proposal.  The screening \nassessment should be formally recorded in a management of change register once \ninternal licensee approval to further develop the proposal has been gained. \n\n5.47  Change classification or categorisation methodology should consider the risks \n\nassociated with the change being inadequately conceived or executed, and should not \ntake planned mitigation into account.  ONR expects the change classification or \ncategory of all changes to be independently challenged prior to implementation \nproportionally.  \n\n5.48  ONR normally expects the number of change proposals which fall into the top category \n\nto be relatively few.  These ordinarily include proposals which constitute wholesale \norganisational change or which potentially challenge the basis upon which the licence \nwas granted.  Licensees usually have three further categories of change proposal for \nless significant changes.  Broad guidance on classification of organisational changes \nis given in Appendix 3 for illustrative purposes, and there is guidance in the GPG.  \n\n5.49  The licensee\u2019s arrangements should make appropriate provision for engaging ONR \n\nand, in the case of significant or complex changes, early engagement.  This will allow \nONR to provide advice and guidance to the licensee as appropriate and should \nsimplify ONR permissioning of such changes since it will have prior knowledge of the \nrationale for the change and gained confidence in the licensee\u2019s approach to \nassessing the implications of the change.  This early engagement is particularly \nimportant in a number of cases, for example where a licensee is planning to reduce \nstaff numbers through a redundancy programme where a statutory consultation period \nmay apply.  ONR will expect engagement to have commenced before the statutory \nconsultation period is invoked.  Further examples include where significant change is \nplanned to the management of the organisation. \n\nReport : NS-TAST-GD-048 Revision 5 \nTRIM Ref: 2018/283567 \n\nPage 12 of 25 \n\n \n \n\n\fOffice for Nuclear Regulation  \n \n \n\n  \n\n5.50  ONR expects:  \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\nThe  licensee\u2019s  arrangements  to  affirm  that  Category  1  changes  shall  not \nproceed  without  the  formal  agreement  of  ONR  and  for  such  changes  to  be \nsubmitted  in  writing  to  ONR  in  accordance  with  LC  36  (5).    In  such \ncircumstances it is prudent for the licensee to ensure that sufficient time is built \ninto  the  change  programme  to  provide  for  ONR  assessment  of  the  proposed \nchange.  The licensee should facilitate this through early engagement with ONR \nso that the level of regulatory interest can be established and resources can be \nput in place to assess the change.   \n\nThe  licensee\u2019s  arrangements  for  Category  2  change  proposals  should  require \nthe  change  to  be  submitted  in  writing  to  ONR  a  suitable  period  before  the \nproposed implementation date.  This is at least 20 working days.  If, during this \nperiod,  ONR  informs  the  licensee  in  writing  that  ONR  wishes  to  review  the \nproposal  before  it  proceeds,  the  licensee\u2019s  arrangements  should  confirm  that \nthe  change  will  not  proceed  until  ONR  agreement  is  obtained.  It  is,  again, \nclearly  in  the  licensee\u2019s  interests  to  give  ONR  early  notice  of  Category  2 \nchanges  where  possible  so  that  any  potential  issues  can  be  discussed  and \nresolved  without  undue  impact  on  the  licensee\u2019s  programme  or  a  need  to \ninvoke  the  derived  power  in  the  licensee\u2019s  arrangements.    Where  ONR  does \nnot  intend  to  exercise  the  derived  power  and  permission  the  change,  ONR \nshould  formally  communicate  this  to  the  licensee  in  writing  so  that  it  may \nproceed  with  the  proposed  change  earlier  if  it  chooses.    The  basis  for  ONR\u2019s \ndecision not to exercise the derived power should be documented.  \n\n\uf06e \n\nCategory 3 and 4 changes should be entered into the licensee\u2019s management \nof  change  register  which  should  be  available  for  periodic  sampling  by  the \ninspector. If ONR informs the licensee in writing that ONR wishes to review the \nproposal  before  it  proceeds,  the  licensee\u2019s  arrangements  should  confirm  that \nthe change will not proceed until ONR agreement is obtained.   \n\n5.51  Where an agreement, in accordance with the licensee\u2019s own arrangements, is needed \nfrom ONR to allow a proposed change to proceed, the inspector should arrange for the \nchange to be formally assessed, and a Project Assessment Report (PAR) produced, in \naccordance with ONR\u2019s permissioning procedure.  Once ONR is satisfied that the \nchange may proceed, a Licence Instrument will be issued to the licensee to permission \nthe change.  \n\n5.52  Application of the classification methodology and implementation of management of \nchange arrangements should not allow changes, which if assessed in totality could \nconstitute a Category 1 or 2 change, to be reduced to a number of smaller, lower \nsignificance changes i.e. the arrangements should not allow \u2018salami slicing\u2019.  \n\n5.53  Over time, and with experience, a licensee may develop an appreciation of the likely \n\ncategory for individual changes and will form a view based on an initial, informal \nassessment.  This initial assessment should not be used in place of a comprehensive \nassessment for significant changes, nor should the change originator pre-judge the \ncategorisation of a change without an appropriate assessment of the implications of \nthe change.  \n\n5.54  Some changes may be borderline between two classifications or categories.  In these \nsituations ONR expects the licensee to take a conservative position and consider the \nchange at the higher level.  Some changes may attract key stakeholder interest.  In \nthese situations ONR expects the change to be categorised in accordance with the \nlicensee\u2019s arrangements.  Occasionally a higher level of scrutiny can be applied; this \nwill be viewed positively but is not expected to be normally adopted.   \n\nReport : NS-TAST-GD-048 Revision 5 \nTRIM Ref: 2018/283567 \n\nPage 13 of 25 \n\n \n \n\n\fOffice for Nuclear Regulation  \n \n \n\n5.55  The inspector should consider whether or not:  \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\nAn  initial  screening  assessment  has  been  prepared  to  identify  the  potential \nimpact of the change proposal on nuclear safety significance and categorise the \nproposal;  \n\nThe  risk  assessment  uses  a  clear,  consistent  and  well-informed  approach \nwhich identifies potential risks arising both from the final outcome of the change \nand the process of transition;  \n\nThe  classification  methodology  is  easy  to  understand  and  is  being  applied \nobjectively and consistently, throughout the licensee\u2019s organisation;  \n\nThere  is  a  checking  process  to  confirm  that  changes  have  been  correctly \ncategorised and challenged by a SQEP;  \n\nSafeguards  are  in  place  to  avoid  under-categorisation  of  changes  or  \u2018salami \nslicing\u2019;  \n\nThe  licensee\u2019s  arrangements  identify,  and  meet  ONR\u2019s  expectations  for,  the \nneed to communicate Category 1 and 2 change proposals to ONR and include \na derived power which  will allow  ONR to provide formal  agreement to change \nproposals as set out in the bullet points in paragraph 5.16; \n\nThe licensee\u2019s arrangements encourage authors of change proposals to make \nprovision for timely engagement with ONR. \n\nPrinciple 5  \n\nThe  licensee  should  assess  and  justify  the  safety  of  a  proposed  change, \ncommensurate  with  its  potential  impact  on  safety,  identify  and  implement \nsuitable  controls  to  ensure  nuclear  safety  is  not  adversely  affected  and \nmonitor the implementation of the change \n\n5.56  Changes which are identified via the initial screening assessment as falling into \n\ncategories 1, 2 and 3, as illustrated in Appendix 3, should be subject to a more detailed \nassessment which is documented as part of the justification for the change.  The \njustification should ordinarily include:  \n\nA statement of the reason for and objectives of the change. This is typically \nidentified in the \u2018initial screening assessment\u2019;  \n\nA risk assessment;  \n\nAn implementation plan.  \n\n5.57  Changes assessed as having a significant potential impact on nuclear safety i.e. \n\nCategories 1, 2 should be subject to a more detailed risk assessment which is \ndocumented as part of the justification for the change.  The risk assessment should be \nproportionate to the nuclear safety significance and complexity of the change being \nproposed.  The assessment should identify the \u2018enablers\u2019, or arrangements that need \nto be put in place to facilitate the change proposal and ensure that risks are controlled.  \nThese should include actions required to mitigate the risks arising from both the final \noutcome of the change and during transition as appropriate.  The licensee may identify \na need to undertake a formal workload assessment for changes that have the potential \nto impact on the workload of an individual(s).  \n\n5.58 \n\nIn many cases achieving an adequate assessment is unlikely without active \nconsultation with the staff affected by the proposed change at an appropriate stage.  \nAlthough this can be sensitive, many post holders will have a unique knowledge of how \nthey carry out their work and what its demands are.  \n\nReport : NS-TAST-GD-048 Revision 5 \nTRIM Ref: 2018/283567 \n\nPage 14 of 25 \n\n \n \n\n\fOffice for Nuclear Regulation  \n \n \n\n5.59  The risk assessment for a large, complex change proposal may indicate that it is \n\npreferable to divide the overall change into smaller, more manageable elements.  This \nmay have advantages in that elements can be assigned to different leads that have \nbetter-defined responsibilities and knowledge for taking a change forward.  However, \nthere are risks in this approach because potential dependencies between these \nelements may be missed.  For example, an individual responsible for one element may \nmake assumptions about the continued provision of resources or arrangements that \nmight be affected by changes to other elements.  \n\n5.60 \n\nIn such instances, the licensee should produce an umbrella or \u2018overarching\u2019 \nmanagement of change proposal to define the scope of the overall proposal and set a \nsingle, coherent framework for managing the different elements which are \nencompassed within it.  The risk assessment for the overarching management of \nchange should reference the risks related to specific elements, but should also take a \nbroader cross-cutting perspective. It should also consider risks arising at the interfaces \nbetween the various elements. \n\n5.61  ONR expects the licensee to put in place suitable processes for endorsing change \n\nproposals.  Usually, Category 3 and 4 changes may be endorsed by the originator or \nlocal process owner following an independent review of the classification or category.  \nHowever, Category 1 and 2 changes should be endorsed by an individual who has a \nfull understanding of the implications of the proposed change.  Such individuals are \nmore likely to be at a more senior level in the licensee organisation.  \n\n5.62  As noted in Principle 3, justification documents for Category 1 and 2 arrangements \n\nmay need advice by a Nuclear Safety Committee or an equivalent body in accordance \nwith the licensee\u2019s arrangements.  \n\n5.63  The mitigating actions and enablers identified in the risk assessment should, following \n\nendorsement, be addressed in an implementation plan.  The implementation plan \nshould show how the mitigating actions and enablers will be delivered and managed.  \nIt should include a clear definition of responsibilities for taking forward the change and \nmaintaining a suitable level of managerial oversight.  For example, the inspector \nshould be able to find evidence that documentation has been endorsed to confirm that \nenabling actions have been completed and to confirm that the change may proceed.  \n\n5.64  The output of a risk assessment may indicate that it is preferable to introduce the \n\nchange on a phased or staged basis as a means of best managing the risks \nassociated with the change.  This should be reflected in the implementation plan, and \nthe licensee should consider introducing stage gates, or hold points, as necessary to \nmanage the process.  ONR interaction may be considered appropriate by the licensee \nor ONR for some of these stages, depending on the nuclear safety significance.  \n\n5.65  The implementation plan should also include indicators that can be used to monitor \n\nprogress in implementing the change and provide confidence that no adverse effects \nare being realised.  These indicators may be qualitative or quantitative as appropriate.  \nThey should primarily be \u2018leading\u2019 indicators that consider the potential consequences \nof the change being inadequately conceived or executed such as training completed; \novertime worked; maintenance backlogs etc., rather than \u2018lagging\u2019 indicators which \ntypically monitor reduction in accident rates.  \n\n5.66  Significant changes i.e. those identified as Category 1 or 2 in Appendix 3, should have \n\nBoard/Executive oversight, using indicators and any other appropriate measures, to \nconfirm that changes are being correctly managed.  In the event that a change is not \nproceeding satisfactorily the Board/Executive should identify and sponsor remedial \naction.  This monitoring should be proportionate to the significance of the change and \ncontinue for the life of the change. It should also include a post-completion review to \nconfirm that the objectives of the change have been satisfactorily achieved.  \n\nReport : NS-TAST-GD-048 Revision 5 \nTRIM Ref: 2018/283567 \n\nPage 15 of 25 \n\n \n \n\n\fOffice for Nuclear Regulation  \n \n \n\n5.67  Where possible, the implementation plan should reflect potential contingency actions \n\nthat may be required in the event that the change is not proceeding as planned.  \nWhere potential consequences are high it may be appropriate for the licensee to \nmaintain for a suitable period the capability to reverse the change.  \n\n5.68 \n\nJustification documents should be formally signed off when the change is complete \nand should be retained as a record in accordance with the licensee\u2019s LC 6 \narrangements.  It can be helpful to \u2018close out\u2019 the change at an appropriate date, after \nthe outcome has been monitored and sufficient confidence has been gained that the \nchange need not be reversed or altered significantly.  \n\n5.69  Under LC36 (6), ONR may direct a licensee to halt a change to its organisation \n\nstructure or resources if it is concerned the change may have been inadequately \nconceived or executed.  In practice, it is envisaged that this power will be used rarely.  \nIn such circumstances, ONR and the licensee should discuss the proposed change \nand seek to resolve any issues such that an agreed way forward is established. If ONR \nis content that the proposed change, amended if necessary, may proceed then it will \nprovide a formal consent to permit it to progress.  \n\n5.70  The inspector should consider whether or not:  \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\nAssessments  of  proposed  changes  are  proportionate  to  the  significance  and \ncategory of the change;  \n\nAssessments  have  been  carried  out  by  competent  persons  and  adequately \nconsider \nthe  change  be \ninadequately conceived or executed;  \n\nthe  range  of  potential  consequences  should \n\nThe  licensee  has  acknowledged  the  need  to  develop  an  \u2018overarching \n\u2018management of change assessment as a means of defining and coordinating \nlarger, more complex changes;  \n\nThe  licensee\u2019s  arrangements  provide  for  a  staged  approach  to  implementing \nlarger,  complex  changes  and  make  provision  for  ONR  intervention  as \nappropriate;  \n\nJustification documents have been formally endorsed to confirm that proposed \nchanges  may  proceed  and  signed  off  upon  completion  of  necessary  enabling \nactions by a SQEP; \n\nChanges  have  been  adequately  documented  to  enable  the  objective  of  the \nchange, and the change categorisation to be clearly understood; \n\nEnabling and mitigating actions for Category 1 and 2 changes are relevant and \nsatisfactorily address the identified risks;  \n\nThe  licensee\u2019s  senior  management  and  the  Nuclear  Safety  Committee  have \nbeen  involved  in  considering  the  implications  a  Category  1  change  prior  to  \nimplementation;  \n\nArrangements  are  in  place  in  the  licensee  organisation  to  monitor  Category  1 \nand 2 changes and, in the event that a change is not proceeding satisfactorily, \nto initiate remedial action;  \n\nSuitable  qualitative  or  quantitative \nindicators  have  been  developed \nsignificant changes and if they are linked to enabling and remedial actions;  \n\nfor \n\nThe indicators are being used to monitor the effectiveness of implementation of \nsignificant changes;  \n\nThere  is  a  process  to  check  the  quality  and  consistency  of  justification \ndocuments;  \n\nReport : NS-TAST-GD-048 Revision 5 \nTRIM Ref: 2018/283567 \n\nPage 16 of 25 \n\n \n \n\n\fOffice for Nuclear Regulation  \n \n \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\nJustification  documents  are  filed  within  a  site-wide  system  and  available  for \nscrutiny;  \n\nThere  is  a  post-change  review  process  to  enable  learning  points  from \nsuccessful  and  unsuccessful  changes  to  be  taken  into  account  for  future \nchanges  and,  if  appropriate,  incorporated  into  the  licensee\u2019s  management  of \nchange arrangements.  \n\nPrinciple 6  \n\nThe  licensee  should  periodically  review  the  effectiveness  of  the  overall \narrangements and the changes that have been implemented.  \n\n5.71  The licensee should be encouraged to capture the learning gained from applying its \n\nmanagement of change process, especially to larger and more complex changes.  This \nshould be reflected, where appropriate, in changed arrangements e.g. training.

This  may  result  in  inadequate  resources  being  available  to \nfulfil baseline organisational roles.  \n\nSales,  acquisitions,  mergers  or  creation  of  subsidiary  companies.    This \nmay  lead  to  a  loss  of  nuclear  related  expertise  at  Board  and  Executive  level, \nresulting in a lack of understanding of what is required to maintain the defence \nin  depth  which  is  essential  to  the  achievement  of  very  high  levels  of  safety.  \nCorporate  mergers  may  result  in  a  lack  of  harmonisation  of  standards  and \nprocedures,  and  a \nresponsibilities  and \nlack  of  clarity  of  managerial \naccountabilities.  \n\nDownsizing,  re-engineering  and  outsourcing. \nin \nunderstaffing  and  lack  of  competent  staff  or  'intelligent  customer'  capability  to \nmake  an  informed  judgement.    It  may  lead  to  instances  where  there  is \ninsufficient  competent  staff  available  to  assess  the  safety  significance  of \nactivities with the potential to impact on nuclear safety, or the loss of \u2018corporate \nmemory\u2019 in a particular field.  \n\n  This  may \n\nresult \n\nReduction  of  the  numbers  of  layers  of  management.    This  may  result  in \ninadequate supervision or oversight of staff work, or an unacceptable increase \nin individual workload or management spans of control. \n\nOrganisational  development.    This  is  particularly  appropriate  in  the  case  of \nnew  build  organisations  where  the  organisation  structure  may  change  several \ntimes as the project progress both within a particular project phase and as the \nproject progresses from one phase to the next. \n\nOrganisational  restructuring  and  change  initiatives.    This  may  result  in \ncompetent staff being diverted to restructuring/change projects.  \n\nDowngrading  the  Head  of  Safety  post  so  that  he  or  she  is  no  longer  a \nmember of the licensee\u2019s Executive or Board, resulting in a loss of independent, \nauthoritative advice for nuclear safety at Board level.  \n\nRelocation of offices.  This may result in the loss of key staff and expertise in \ncritical areas.  \n\nChanges  in  policies  for  recruitment  and  training  of  staff.    This  may  result \nfrom national skills shortages, demographics etc leading to vacancies not being \nfilled,  recruitment  of  poor  quality  staff,  and  degradation  of  the  competence  of \nindividuals and the organisation as a whole. \n\nChange  in  Board  /  Executive.    Although  not  necessarily  an  organisational \nchange  this  change  could  still result  in  significant  safety  risks.    Organisational \nchange control can be used as a flexible risk assessment tool in these cases, \nwhich is seen as good practice, allowing the organisation to manage potential \nrisks.  \n\n \n \n\nReport : NS-TAST-GD-048 Revision 5 \nTRIM Ref: 2018/283567 \n\nPage 19 of 25 \n\n \n \n\n\fOffice for Nuclear Regulation  \n \n \n\nAPPENDIX 3 : BROAD GUIDANCE ON CLASSIFICATION OF ORGANISATIONAL \nCHANGES \n\n6.3 \n\nThe approach to classifying changes may vary according to licensee. The following \nexample classifications are provided for illustrative purposes to guide the inspector:  \n\n\uf06e \n\nCategory 1 changes, which if inadequately conceived or executed, could result \nin a major reduction in the standards of nuclear safety with the potential for on-\nsite and off-site impact such as:  \n\no  Wide  ranging  company  or  site  changes  that  have  the  potential  to  affect  the \n\nvalidity of, or basis on which, the nuclear site licence was granted.  \n\no  Changes resulting in the granting of a new site licence.  \n\no  Sale, acquisition or merger of a licensee organisation or a nuclear licensed site.  \n\no  Changes involving more than one business unit, division or site.  \n\no  Large-scale downsizing or outsourcing of a nuclear safety significant function.  \n\n\uf06e \n\nCategory 2 changes, which if inadequately conceived or executed, could result \nin a significant reduction in the standards of nuclear safety with the potential to \naffect a large proportion of or the whole of a site such as:  \n\no  Changes that affect people within a whole facility.  \n\no  Changes that affect a whole department or large groups of staff.  \n\no  Changes that affect several layers of management.  \n\no  Significant reduction in the size of a team that has an EH&S role.  \n\no  Changes  with  significant  potential  to  adversely  impact  on  a  site\u2019s  emergency \n\nresponse.  \n\no  Changes  resulting  in  a  significant  transfer  of  key  EH&S  accountabilities  and \n\nresponsibilities such as those associated with DAP duties. \n\no  Changes in staff shift patterns   \n\n\uf06e \n\nCategory 3 changes, which if inadequately conceived or executed, could result \nin  a  minor  reduction  in  the  standards  of  nuclear  safety  with  the  potential  to \naffect a single plant, department or business unit such as:  \n\no  Changes that affect staff within one process area or a significant part of a plant.  \n\no  Changes that affect a small group of staff, such as part of a department.  \n\no  Small reduction in the size of a team.  \n\no  Changes  in  management  accountabilities/responsibilities  that  have  a  small \n\nimpact on EH&S.  \n\no  Transfer of responsibilities between departments/units. \n\n\uf06e \n\n Category 4 changes with negligible or no effect on nuclear safety such as:  \n\no  Changes  to  organisational  responsibilities  that  do  not  lead  to  a  significant \n\nincrease in the workload of any line manager or group of staff.  \n\no  A reduction in the size of a team that has little or no EH&S role.  \n\no  Staff  being  moved  or  leaving  following  completion  of  a  project  or  package  of \n\nwork. \n\nReport : NS-TAST-GD-048 Revision 5 \nTRIM Ref: 2018/283567 \n\nPage 20 of 25 \n\n \n \n\n\fOffice for Nuclear Regulation  \n \n \n\n6.4 \n\n6.5 \n\n6.6 \n\nAPPENDIX  4:  GUIDANCE  TO  INSPECTORS  ON  THE  APPROACH  TO  BE \nUNDERTAKEN  FOR  ASSURING  COMPLIANCE  WITH  THE  \u2018ADEQUACY  OF \nFINANCIAL RESOURCES\u2019 ASPECT OF LC 36(1) \n\nThe purpose of this appendix is to support a proportionate and consistent regulatory \napproach to ONR inspection and assessment against the financial resources aspect of \nLC 36 (1) \u2018Organisational Capability\u2019.  \n\nPurpose and scope  \n\nBackground  \n\nArticle 6(5) of the Nuclear Safety Directive 2009/71/Euratom requires member states to \nensure that licensees are required to provide and maintain adequate financial and \nhuman resources to fulfil their obligations in respect of nuclear safety.  In order to \nensure that this requirement was fully transposed in Great Britain, LC 36 was changed \nin July 2011 to introduce a revised LC 36(1) which requires licensees to provide and \nmaintain adequate financial and human resources to ensure the safe operation of the \nlicensed site.  \n\nONR consulted with all nuclear site licence holders on this amendment (and a \nproposed modification to LC 17) and conducted an impact assessment.  ONR also \npublished a supporting note advising that ONR considered licensees would already \ncomply with the requirement to provide and maintain adequate human resources, by \nvirtue of their Nuclear Baseline.  The note also stated that: \u201cOn a day-to-day basis, \ncompliance with legal duties to ensure an appropriate level of nuclear safety is likely to \nbe sufficient evidence of compliance with the licence condition regarding the licensee\u2019s \nexisting financial resources\u201d.  With regard to the requirement to maintain adequate \nfinancial resources, ONR\u2019s view is that the licensee should be able to clearly \ndemonstrate that it:  \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\n\uf06e \n\nUnderstands  the  hazards  and  risks  of  its  undertakings  and  is  operating  in \naccordance with its safety case and complying with the licence conditions;  \n\nIs  reducing  risk  so  far  as  is  reasonably  practicable,  and  implementing \nimprovements in a timely manner where these are identified as ALARP;  \n\nIs  maintaining  an  adequate  Nuclear  Baseline  resource  and  implementing  its \narrangements for managing organisational change set out under LC 36(2);  \n\nHas  assessed  what  financial  resources  are  necessary  to  continue  to  meet \nthose needs;  \n\nHas, and is maintaining, or has in place arrangements to obtain, the necessary \nfinancial resources; and  \n\n\uf06e \n\nHas relevant records and they are being retained in accordance with LC 6.  \n\nGuidance on inspection of arrangements \n\nRegulatory Approach \n\n6.7 \n\nThe financial resources of a licensee are not ordinarily the focus of routine inspection \nactivities.  Rather, inspectors should be alert to indirect evidence that may indicate a \nreduction in the ability or willingness of the licensee to provide or maintain adequate \nfinancial resources to ensure safety.  Evidence may include failure to resource plant \nimprovements; staff shortages that are not being filled; delays in delivering activities \nsuch as maintenance etc.  Should indications be found that investment in safety-\nrelated plant or people may not be adequate to provide and maintain safety, the \ninspector should seek to establish whether it is attributable to other factors (for \nexample difficulties in identifying SQEP resource; technical difficulties or \ndisagreements etc.) and, if so, to progress the matter in the normal manner.  \n\nReport : NS-TAST-GD-048 Revision 5 \nTRIM Ref: 2018/283567 \n\nPage 21 of 25 \n\n \n \n\n\fOffice for Nuclear Regulation  \n \n \n\n6.8 \n\nIf the safety issue cannot be resolved to the satisfaction of the inspector, and financial \nresource issues are identified as a possible factor, this matter should be elevated to \nthe relevant Superintending Inspector and Professional lead for consideration.  It is \nanticipated that discussions will take place with the licensee to determine the cause of \nthe issue and attempt to resolve it.  This may entail an ONR review of safety cases; \nannual financial accounts, plans for construction and key financial decision points; \ninvestment plans; lifetime plans, the nuclear baseline and other documents.  If the \nissue cannot be resolved, and failure to comply with LC 36(1) is suspected, \nconsideration may be given to engaging external expert financial advice to inform the \nprocess of establishing ONR\u2019s enforcement options.  The need to take this course of \naction is expected to be rare.  \n\n6.9  Where the licensee's budget is controlled by another body (for example, the Nuclear \n\nDecommissioning Authority (NDA) or a parent organisation), financial (and other \nresourcing) arrangements are likely to be set out in contractual arrangements such as \na Shareholders Agreement between the licensee and the controlling body.  ONR may \nseek to examine these documents.  ONR anticipates that the controlling body will co-\noperate with the licensee in ensuring the adequacy of the resources needed for safety, \nand to meet its obligations under HSWA Section 3(1).  The licensee, however, retains \nan absolute responsibility for nuclear safety.  \n\nGovernment assurances regarding a licensee\u2019s financial standing  \n\n6.10  ONR will approach the relevant government department at the time of processing a \n\nlicence application, or responding to a request for relicensing, to seek its assurances \nregarding the applicant\u2019s financial status.  ONR may, on rare occasions when it deems \nit relevant, also seek such assurances from government to inform ONR\u2019s approach \nset out in paragraphs 6.7 to 6.9 above.  Government assurances will be used by \nONR to provide confidence that, at the point of licensing, an organisation\u2019s financial \narrangements are adequate to enable it to fulfil its obligations as a nuclear site \nlicence holder.  Subsequent to the granting of a licence, the approach set out in \nparagraphs 6.7 to 6.9 above will be followed. \n\nReport : NS-TAST-GD-048 Revision 5 \nTRIM Ref: 2018/283567 \n\nPage 22 of 25 \n\n \n \n\n\fOffice for Nuclear Regulation  \n \n \n\n APPENDIX 5: GUIDANCE FOR INSPECTORS ON THE FACTORS THAT MAY BE \nCONSIDERED  WHEN  INSPECTING  THE  LICENSEE\u2019S  IMPLEMENTATION  OF  ITS \nMANAGEMENT OF CHANGE ARRANGEMENTS \n\n6.11  The following \u2018short-form\u2019 guidance is provided to assist inspectors to judge the \n\nadequacy of licensees\u2019 arrangements to comply with LC 36 clauses (2) to (5).

This document contains Fundamental Security \nPrinciples (FSyPs) that dutyholders must demonstrate have been fully taken into \naccount in developing their security arrangements to meet relevant legal obligations. \nThe security regime for meeting these principles is described in security plans \nprepared by the dutyholders, which are approved by ONR under the Nuclear Industries \nSecurity Regulations (NISR) 2003 (Reference 2). \n\nThe term \u2018security plan\u2019 is used to cover all dutyholder submissions such as nuclear \nsite security plans, temporary security plans and transport security statements. NISR \nRegulation 22 dutyholders may also use the SyAPs as the basis for Cyber Security \nand Information Assurance (CS&IA) documentation that helps them demonstrate \nongoing legal compliance for the protection of Sensitive Nuclear Information (SNI). The \nSyAPs are supported by a suite of guides to assist ONR inspectors in their \nassessment and inspection work, and in making regulatory judgements and decisions.  \nThis Technical Assessment Guidance (TAG) is such a guide. \n\n2. \n\nPURPOSE AND SCOPE \n\nThis TAG contains guidance to advise and inform ONR inspectors in exercising their \nregulatory judgment during assessment activities relating to a dutyholder\u2019s supply \nchain management arrangements.  It aims to provide general advice and guidance to \nONR inspectors on how this aspect of security should be assessed. It does not set out \nhow ONR regulates the dutyholder\u2019s arrangements.  It does not prescribe the detail, \ntargets or methodologies for dutyholders to follow in demonstrating they have \naddressed the SyAPs. It is the dutyholder\u2019s responsibility to determine and describe \nthis detail and for ONR to assess whether the arrangements are adequate. \n\n3. \n\nRELATIONSHIP TO RELEVANT LEGISLATION \n\nThe term \u2018dutyholder\u2019 mentioned throughout this guide is used to define \u2018responsible \npersons\u2019 on civil nuclear licensed sites and other nuclear premises subject to security \nregulation, a \u2018developer\u2019 carrying out work on a nuclear construction site and approved \ncarriers, as defined in NISR. It is also used to refer to those holding SNI. \n\nNISR defines a \u2018nuclear premises\u2019 and requires \u2018the responsible person\u2019 as defined to \nhave an approved security plan in accordance with Regulation 4. It further defines \napproved carriers and requires them to have an approved Transport Security \nStatement in accordance with Regulation 16. Persons to whom Regulation 22 applies \nare required to protect SNI. ONR considers supply chain management to be an \nimportant component of a dutyholder\u2019s arrangements in demonstrating compliance \nwith relevant legislation. \n\n4. \n\nRELATIONSHIP TO IAEA DOCUMENTATION AND GUIDANCE \n\n4.1 \n\nThe essential elements of a national nuclear security regime are set out in the \nConvention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material (CPPNM) (Reference 3) and \nthe IAEA Nuclear Security Fundamentals (Reference 4). Further guidance is available \nwithin IAEA Technical Guidance and Implementing Guides. \n\n \n \nOFFICIAL  \n \n \n\nReport CNS-TAST-GD-4.3 \nTRIM Ref: 2017/106068 \n\nPage 2 of 9 \n\n\fOffice for Nuclear Regulation  \n \n \n\nOFFICIAL  \n \n \n\n4.2 \n\nFundamental Principle J of the CPPNM refers to quality assurance and states that \u2018a \nquality assurance policy and quality assurance programmes should be established and \nimplemented with a view to providing confidence that specified requirements for all \nactivities important to physical protection are satisfied\u2019. The importance of issues \nrelating to assurance activities are also recognised in the Nuclear Security \nFundamentals, specifically: \n\n\uf0b7 \n\nEssential Element 12: Sustaining a Nuclear Security Regime \u2013 3.12  \n\nh) Routinely performing assurance activities to identify and address issues \nand factors that may affect the capacity to provide adequate nuclear \nsecurity including cyber security at all times. \n\nA more detailed description of the elements is provided in Recommendations level \nguidance, specifically Nuclear Security Series (NSS) 13, Recommendations on \nPhysical Protection of Nuclear Material and Nuclear Facilities (INFCIRC/225/Revision \n5) (Reference 5). \n\n5. \n\nRELATIONSHIP TO NATIONAL POLICY DOCUMENTS \n\nThe SyAPs provide ONR inspectors with a framework for making consistent regulatory \njudgements on the effectiveness of a dutyholder\u2019s security arrangements.  This TAG \nprovides guidance to ONR inspectors when assessing a dutyholder\u2019s submission \ndemonstrating they have effective processes in place to achieve SyDP 4.3 \u2013 Oversight \nof Suppliers, in support of FSyP 4 \u2013 Nuclear Supply Chain Management.  The TAG is \nconsistent with other TAGs and associated guidance and policy documentation. \n\nThe HMG Security Policy Framework (SPF) (Reference 6) describes the Cabinet \nSecretary\u2019s expectations of how HMG organisations and third parties handling HMG \ninformation and other assets will apply protective security to ensure HMG can function \neffectively, efficiently and securely. The security outcomes and requirements detailed \nin the SPF have been incorporated within the SyAPs. This ensures that dutyholders \nare presented with a coherent set of expectations for the protection of nuclear \npremises, SNI and the employment of appropriate personnel security controls both on \nand off nuclear premises. \n\n5.3 \n\nThe Classification Policy (Reference 7) indicates those categories of SNI, which \nrequire protection and the level of security classification to be applied. \n\n6. \n\nADVICE TO INSPECTORS \n\nThis TAG is to be used by inspectors in their assessment of the adequacy of the \ndutyholder\u2019s arrangements for the supply chain management of items or services of \nnuclear security significance. \n\nThe effective procurement of items and services is a fundamental element in the \nprovision of an adequate security infrastructure to deliver an appropriate and enduring \nsecurity effect. \n\n4.3 \n\n5.1 \n\n5.2 \n\n6.1 \n\n6.2 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \nOFFICIAL  \n \n \n\nReport CNS-TAST-GD-4.3 \nTRIM Ref: 2017/106068 \n\nPage 3 of 9 \n\n\fOffice for Nuclear Regulation  \n \n \n\nOFFICIAL  \n \n \n\nRegulatory Expectations \n\n6.3 \n\nThe regulatory expectation is that dutyholders will describe in the security plan how \nthey apply oversight of suppliers of items or services of nuclear security significance to \nsupport effective nuclear supply chain management arrangements. \n\nFSyP 4 - Nuclear Supply Chain \nManagement \n\nOversight of Suppliers of Items or \nServices of Nuclear Security \nSignificance \n\nSyDP 4.3 \n\nDutyholders should conduct effective oversight and assurance of their supply chain.  \n\n \nThe purchaser should establish an effective commercial and/or Supply Chain strategy \nto enable effective delivery of items and/or services. The purchaser\u2019s commercial \nand/or Supply Chain strategy will influence all arrangements associated with the \nprocurement security items or services. An effective strategy with appropriate oversight \nand assurance, deployed through the organisation\u2019s business planning process should \nensure delivery of an effective security solution. \n\nOversight arrangements should include measures to review contracts, how \nrelationships are managed and performance analysis of vendors. \n\nThere are parties who might wish to substitute counterfeit, fraudulent or suspect items \nfor genuine items or services for commercial gain and assurance activities should \ninclude a focus on the application of processes to prevent such items from entering the \nSupply Chain. Of equal concern is that parties may wish to incorporate a \u2018back door\u2019 to \nOperational Technology or Information Technology (OT/IT) to allow subsequent ease \nof access following installation. Dutyholders should be aware that such \u2018back doors\u2019 \ncan create significant vulnerabilities and give specific consideration to mitigate their \nintroduction. There is also the possibility that a party acting maliciously may wish to \nintroduce latent defects (for example by installing malware on OT/IT) for subsequent \nexploitation.  Dutyholders and their supply chain should recognise these issues and \nhave in place appropriate arrangements to mitigate them. \n\n6.7 \n\nAssurance activities should ensure appropriate arrangements are in place for all \ncontracts involving security classified information or equipment including that \nconsidered SNI in accordance with FSyP7 and its associated delivery principles. \n\n7. \n\nSUPPLY CHAIN OVERSIGHT AND ASSURANCE \n\nThe dutyholder should conduct effective oversight and assurance of the Supply Chain, \nincluding the acceptance of items or services for work with security significance. \n\nThe dutyholder should establish effective arrangements for the oversight of supplier \nperformance throughout the contract period and their quality assurance to ensure that \nitems or services will meet the specified intent. The dutyholder should ensure that it \nhas sufficient capability to oversee and assure performance throughout the tiers of the \nSupply Chain. Assurance activities should include the inspection, test, release, \nacceptance and storage of security significant items and services. \n\n6.4 \n\n6.5 \n\n6.6 \n\n7.1 \n\n7.2 \n\n \n \nOFFICIAL  \n \n \n\nReport CNS-TAST-GD-4.3 \nTRIM Ref: 2017/106068 \n\nPage 4 of 9 \n\n\fOffice for Nuclear Regulation  \n \n \n\nOFFICIAL  \n \n \n\n7.3 \n\n7.4 \n\n7.5 \n\nDutyholders should develop and retain sufficient Intelligent Customer capability to \nspecify, conduct oversight and assurance, monitor manufacturing, fabrication and \ntesting, and acceptance for technical adequacy of the items or services being \npurchased. \n\nThe dutyholder\u2019s oversight and assurance arrangements should review the supplier\u2019s \nsecurity culture and procedures, during and post contract award to ensure the Supply \nChain organisations and their leaders continue to understand and promote the \nimportance of nuclear security and the contribution of any security significant \nequipment or service they supply, to achieving the requirements of the dutyholder. \n\nThe level of oversight and assurance deployed by the dutyholder should be guided by \nthe performance of the supplier or Supply Chain. If performance is below expectation \nthen the dutyholder should increase the level of engagement, oversight and assurance \ncontrols until supplier performance meets expectations or until completion or \ntermination of the contract. Conversely, if a supplier demonstrates routine delivery to \nthe specified requirements, right first time, every time, the dutyholder may consider a \nchange to the method and extent of oversight and assurance as appropriate (i.e. from \nrelease inspection at the manufacturer\u2019s works to receipt inspection at the purchaser\u2019s \nfacility).  \n\nOversight \n\n7.6 \n\nThe level of oversight deployed by the dutyholder should be commensurate with the \nimpact of the item or service if it fails to meet the specified intent. The dutyholder\u2019s \napproach should be influenced by the type of contract, the performance of the supplier, \ntheir suppliers and the implications to security of poor performance. Dutyholders are \nlikely to deploy some or all of the following approaches: \n\n\uf0b7  Contract Review \u2013 Meetings between the supplier and dutyholder should \nreview performance and delivery issues including security requirements.  \n\n\uf0b7  Supplier Relationship Management \u2013 Used to maintain effective relationships \n\nbetween the supplier and dutyholder throughout the contract period to achieve \ncommon objectives. Effective relationship management should support a \ncollaborative approach between the dutyholder and supplier. \n\n\uf0b7  Vendor Analysis \u2013 Performance analysis throughout the contract period with \n\ndata collated on contract success criteria, delivery to correct quality, schedule \nand cost. Vendor analysis may be utilised to target and demonstrate \nimprovements, rank and rate suppliers and maintain a dutyholder\u2019s preferred \nsuppliers listing. \n\n\uf0b7  Review of the supplier\u2019s quality assurance arrangements to ensure appropriate \nstandards are also applied to their suppliers alongside appropriate testing of \nthese items on receipt.  \n\n7.7 \n\nThe dutyholder\u2019s Supply Chain oversight arrangements should generate quantitative \nand qualitative performance data to demonstrate that suppliers of security significant \nitems or services will meet specified target levels. Dutyholders should instigate \nremedial measures as appropriate, which may include withdrawal of contract, to \naddress sub-standard performance that may impact nuclear security. \n\n \n \nOFFICIAL  \n \n \n\nReport CNS-TAST-GD-4.3 \nTRIM Ref: 2017/106068 \n\nPage 5 of 9 \n\n\fOffice for Nuclear Regulation  \n \n \n\nAssurance \n\nOFFICIAL  \n \n \n\n7.8 \n\n7.9 \n\n7.10 \n\nThe dutyholder should have suitable assurance and acceptance processes for items or \nservices being supplied or undertaken by others on its behalf. The level of assurance, \ninspection and test deployed upon item or service completion should be \ncommensurate with the security significance of the item or service being supplied. \n\nAcceptance of items or services may include verification or independent assessment \nusing second or independent third party organisations. This should be planned and \nexecuted, in part, by the application of quality plans. This approach provides essential \nlevels of assurance which are in addition to that provided through the supplier\u2019s own \nquality arrangements. \n\nIn deciding the levels of assurance, in addition to the security significance of the item \nor service, the dutyholder should consider: the level of assurance normally applied to \nthe item or service for its intended use, the code/standard requirements, and the \ndifficulty of inspection and testing post-manufacture or installation. It is important that \nONR has access to all parties that are carrying out quality related activities if \nrequested. Access is normally arranged through the dutyholder. This should include \nlower-tier suppliers. \n\n7.11  The dutyholder\u2019s assurance activities should examine the effectiveness of \n\narrangements for the transport, receipt and storage of items or assembly sub-\ncomponents within the dutyholder\u2019s facilities prior to delivery from the supplier. The \nstorage arrangements should be sufficient to maintain item traceability and prevent \ndamage, loss, deterioration, tampering or inadvertent use. \n\nInspectors should consider: \n\n\uf0b7  Do the dutyholder\u2019s oversight and assurance processes allow them control of \ntheir supply chain management and procurement process arrangements for \nsecurity significant items, from specification of requirement and sourcing a \nsupplier including contract award, through to manufacture of item, construction \nof facility or provision of item or service? \n\n\uf0b7  Does the dutyholder confirm through its oversight and assurance processes \nthat its expectations are understood, communicated throughout the Supply \nChain and routinely reviewed to ensure that suppliers have appropriate \nunderstanding of the security application and importance of their high \nconsequence items or services? \n\n\uf0b7  Does the dutyholder have sufficient capability to oversee and assess \n\nperformance throughout the Supply Chain, and confirm that the level of \noversight and assurance deployed by the supplier post contract award is \ncommensurate with the risk of the item or service failing to meet the specified \nintent? These QA arrangements for the supply chain may be delivered by the \nprincipal contractor employed by the dutyholder. \n\n\uf0b7  Does the dutyholder utilise qualitative and quantitative data to demonstrate \nsupplier performance during contract execution and instigate remedial \nmeasures where appropriate? \n\n \n \nOFFICIAL  \n \n \n\nReport CNS-TAST-GD-4.3 \nTRIM Ref: 2017/106068 \n\nPage 6 of 9 \n\n\fOffice for Nuclear Regulation  \n \n \n\nOFFICIAL  \n \n \n\n\uf0b7 \n\nIs the dutyholder carrying out adequate and appropriate assurance and \nacceptance of items or services being supplied or undertaken by others on its \nbehalf? \n\n\uf0b7  Are any Inspection Agencies used competent to provide third party assurance \n\nand verification of items or services significant to security? \n\n\uf0b7  Do the dutyholder\u2019s assurance processes undertake regular reviews of the \n\nsupplier\u2019s quality activities including the release of hold points, with the level of \nevidence to support hold point release defined and tested?  \n\n\uf0b7  Do the dutyholder\u2019s assurance processes undertake regular reviews of \n\nsupplier\u2019s quality activities for Technical Queries (TQs), with a specific focus on \nthe aggregation of multiple TQs? \n\n\uf0b7  Does the dutyholder seek assurance from suppliers that the measures \nintroduced to prevent CSFI from entering supply chain are in place and \neffective? \n\n \n\n \n \nOFFICIAL  \n \n \n\nReport CNS-TAST-GD-4.3 \nTRIM Ref: 2017/106068 \n\nPage 7 of 9 \n\n\fOffice for Nuclear Regulation  \n \n \n\nREFERENCES \n\nOFFICIAL  \n \n \n\n8. \n\n \n1. \n \n2. \n \n3. \n\n \n4. \n\n \n5.  \n\n \n \n6. \n\nSecurity Assessment Principles \u2013 Trim Ref. 2017/121036   \n\nNuclear Industries Security Regulations 2003.

This book presents step-by-step application of project man- \nagement techniques to managing oil and gas projects. The book uses the \nProject Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK\u00ae) framework from the \nProject Management Institute (PMI) as the platform for the topics covered. \nThe book also strongly advocates a world systems approach to managing oil \nand gas projects and programs. Both quantitative and qualitative techniques \nare covered in the book. Thus, the book addresses technical and managerial \naspects of projects in the oil and gas industry. Technical project management \nis the basis for sustainable national advancement, which often depends on \nthe development of the oil and gas industry. As such, managing oil and gas \nprojects effectively is essential for national economic vitality. Project man- \nagement is the process of managing, allocating, and timing resources to \nachieve a given goal in an efficient and expeditious manner. The objectives \nthat constitute the specified goal may be in terms of time, costs, or technical \nresults. A project can range from the very simple to the very complex. Due \nto its expanding utility and relevance, project management has emerged as \na separate body of knowledge that is embraced by various disciplines rang- \ning from engineering and business to social services. Project management \ntechniques are widely used in many endeavors, including construction \nmanagement, banking, manufacturing, engineering management, market- \ning, health care delivery systems, transportation, research and development, \ndefense, and public services. The application of project management is par- \nticularly of high value in science, technology, and engineering undertakings, \nsuch as we have in the oil and gas industry. In today's fast-changing IT-based \nand competitive global market, every enterprise must strive to get ahead \nof the competition through effective project management in all facets of its \noperations. \n\nProject management represents an excellent basis for integrating various \nmanagement techniques such as statistics, operations research, Six Sigma, \ncomputer simulation, and so on within the oil and gas industry operations. \nThe purpose of this book is to present an integrated approach to project man- \nagement for oil and gas projects. The integrated approach covers the concepts, \ntools, and techniques (both new and tested) of project management. The ele- \nments of the PMBOK provide a unifying platform for the topics covered in the \nbook. The book is intended to serve as a reference book for planners, project \n\n\n\nxviii Preface \n\n\n\noperators, stakeholders, designers, project managers, business managers, \nconsultants, project analysts, senior executives, project team members, mem- \nbers of project management office, project customers, functional managers, \ntrainers, and researchers. It can also serve as a guidebook for technical con- \nsultants and as a textbook resource for students and educators. It is also useful \nas a supplementary reading for practicing engineers and as a handbook for \nfield operators. It will appeal to petroleum industry professionals because of \nits focused treatment of oil and gas projects. \n\nThe book also contains case examples of applications of project manage- \nment tools and techniques to real-life project scenarios. These could serve as \nlessons learned for best practices in project management. \n\nAdedeji Badiru \nSamuel Osisanya \n\n\n\nAuthors \n\n\n\nAdedeji B.

Energy sup- \nply is needed for heating, cooling, and lighting our homes, business, and \nindustry. Modern communication facilities in the society function only \nwhen consistent energy supply is assured. Since all our modern commercial \nactivities are highly interlinked, we must view the whole as a system of sys- \ntems (SoS) of economic activities. Lorincz (2008) reminded us that the \"thirst \nfor oil and gas won't be satisfied any time soon.\" This is a sentiment that is \nshared by most people both within and outside the oil and gas industry. It is \nforecasted that the need to find replacement supplies of oil and gas to match \nthe global demand for energy will continue to encourage massive capital \nspending in the industry around the world. Much of such investments will \nbe directed at executing multinational projects. Based on the rapid growth of \nthe economies of China and India, the long-term outlook for the oil and gas \nindustry is quite positive. We just have to ensure that projects are planned, \norganized, controlled, and executed constructively through global alliances. \nThe international market price of crude oil is the most crucial factor deter- \nmining the consumer-level price for petroleum-based products. This means \nthat the price of gasoline at the pump is mainly determined by the world- \nwide demand for and supply of crude oil. According to estimates from the \nInternational Energy Agency (IEA),* the world's primary energy needs are \nexpected to grow by 55% between 2005 and 2030, with the demand reach- \ning 17.7 billion tonnes of oil equivalent, compared with 11.4 billion tonnes \nin 2005. The current market of 2012-2013 is already experiencing being on \npace with that demand curve. The challenges that oil and gas projects will \ncontinue to face fall in the following categories: \n\n\u2022 Technical challenges \n\n\u2022 Managerial challenges \n\n\u2022 Human resource challenges \n\nRigorous and disciplined applications of project management tools and \ntechniques can help mitigate these challenges. \n\n\n\nhttp://www.iea.org/stats/index.asp; accessed April 30, 2012. \n\n\n\nProject Management for the Oil and Gas Industry \n\n\n\nA Multitiered Systems View \n\nIt is a systems world. To be successful, all industries must consider a systems \nview of their options. This is particularly most critical for the oil and gas \nindustry, where many multifaceted factors are interlinked. If you do not think \nthat everything is globally connected, consider this fact: A Boeing 747-400 has \nsix million parts (half of which are fasteners) made in 33 different countries. \n\nThis shows that the fates of industries are interconnected throughout the \nentire world in terms of production and consumption activities, particularly \nin the oil and gas sector (Badiru, 2009). This makes it mandatory that we take \na systems view of the world when dealing with oil and gas projects. With \none-third of the electricity produced on Earth being used to power electric \nlight bulbs, we must all work together to pursue more efficient practices. The \nfirst quarter of 2012 saw a significant rise in global crude oil prices. After \nclosing 2011 at $108 per barrel, Brent spot prices exceeded $125 per barrel \nby early March, from whence it traded within a relatively narrow range for \nthe remainder of the month. This price increase reflected changes in global \noil supplies, as significant unplanned disruptions in production from coun- \ntries that are not members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting \nCountries (OPEC) countered the recovery in Libyan production. Project \nmanagement must address these types of developments in day-to-day opera- \ntions in the oil and gas industry. According to an assessment by the U.S. \nGeological Survey (USGS),* excluding the United States, the world holds an \nestimated 565 billion barrels (bbo) of undiscovered, technically recoverable \nconventional oil; 5606 trillion cubic feet (tcf) of undiscovered, technically \nrecoverable conventional natural gas; and 167 bbo of undiscovered, techni- \ncally recoverable natural gas liquids (NGL). The report includes mean esti- \nmates of undiscovered but technically recoverable conventional oil and gas \nresources in 171 geologic provinces of the world. These estimates include \nresources beneath both onshore and offshore areas. All these numbers repre- \nsent technically recoverable oil and gas resources, which are those quantities \nof oil and gas producible using currently available technological and indus- \ntrial practices, regardless of economic or accessibility considerations. This \nassessment does not include reserves \u2014 accumulations of oil or gas that have \nbeen discovered, are well defined, and are considered economically viable. \nTo tap into the proven and estimated oil and gas reserves, many countries \nmust come together in systems-based synergistic national alliances. A sys- \ntems view of the energy world is, thus, required. \n\nThis book uses the project framework view from the field of industrial and \nsystems engineering in consonance with the fundamentals of petroleum \nengineering. Industrial engineering deals with the design and development \nof integrated systems of people, machines, and information resources for producing \n\n\n\nhttp://www.doi.gov/news/pressreleases/USGS; released April 18, 2012. \n\n\n\nWorld Systems Framework for Oil and Gas Industry \n\n\n\nproducts and services. This is precisely what happens in the oil and gas indus- \ntry because of the multifaceted requirements of the industry. Apart from the \nnuclear projects, no other projects generate as much environmental senti- \nments as projects in the oil and gas industry. Thus, formal project manage- \nment should be an essential part of planning, organizing, scheduling, and \ncontrolling projects in the industry. Those who support or oppose oil and gas \nprojects are often uninformed about the merits and demerits of the projects. \nThe techniques of project management can help mitigate such awareness \nproblems. There is a correlation between the application of project manage- \nment and better business performance. For this reason, a framework based \non an SoS modeling is very essential for the oil and gas industry. There are \nthree closely linked global challenges: \n\n1. Increasing energy demand \n\n2. Environmental and climate change \n\n3. National and global security \n\nAttendant with these challenges are the related concerns of science and \ntechnology developments, management of research and development, and \nglobal economic advancement. The major activities of an oil and gas com- \npany revolve around the following elements: \n\n\u2022 Exploration \n\n\u2022 Drilling and production \n\n\u2022 Transportation \n\n\u2022 Refining \n\n\u2022 Marketing \n\nEach of these requires a formal and rigorous application of project man- \nagement. For example, exploratory drilling does the following: \n\n\u2022 Establishes that hydrocarbons exist \n\n\u2022 Determines the quality; oil and gas ratio \n\n\u2022 Establishes the extent of the reservoir \n\n\u2022 Conducts an economic value of the resource \n\n\u2022 Designs a development plan; how the reservoir is to be developed \nfor maximum recovery \n\nDrilling and production require project management for \n\n\u2022 Designing platform \n\n\u2022 Substructure, top side facilities \n\n\n\nProject Management for the Oil and Gas Industry \n\n\n\n\u2022 Fabrication \n\n\u2022 Installation \n\n\u2022 Drilling (early production) \n\n\u2022 Environmental issues \n\n\u2022 Production (separate oil, gas, and water) \n\n\u2022 Transportation \n\n\u2022 Pipelines \n\n\u2022 Off load directly onto tankers \n\nDrilling economics focuses on \n\n\u2022 Optimum drilling practices \n\n\u2022 Cost per foot \n\n\u2022 Break-even curve \n\nMultinational projects particularly pose unique challenges pertaining to \nreliable power supply, efficient communication systems, credible govern- \nment support, dependable procurement processes, consistent availability of \ntechnology, progressive industrial climate, trustworthy risk mitigation infra- \nstructure, regular supply of skilled labor, uniform focus on quality of work, \nglobal consciousness, hassle-free bureaucratic processes, coherent safety and \nsecurity system, steady law and order, unflinching focus on customer sat- \nisfaction, and fair labor relations. Assessing and resolving concerns about \nthese issues in a step-by-step fashion will create a foundation of success for a \nlarge project. While no system can be perfect and satisfactory in all aspects, \na tolerable trade-off on the factors is essential for project success.

Fortunately, the dire energy situ- \nation often creates new innovation and creativity that can facilitate a rapid \nconvergence of technological, political, economic, and managerial processes. \nFigure 1.4 shows the distribution of world energy consumption by sources as \nof 2010 in millions of tons of oil equivalent. As in the case of production, the \ndata show that the oil and gas industry is a major responder to world energy \ndemands. \n\n\n\nSome Case Examples \n\n\n\nSome case examples of the world system of the oil and gas industry are pre- \nsented here. Figure 1.5 shows a typical small-scale \"pecking\" oil well on a \nprivate land in Oklahoma. \n\nAs the world's known oil and gas reserves are running out, the hunt \nfor more is on, even in more remote places on Earth. One such area is the \nBarents Sea, off the northernmost tip of Norway and neighboring Russia. \nBoth Norwegian and Russian authorities say that the potential for future \nfossil energy exploration in this region is quite enormous. Meanwhile, \nenvironmentalists warn of the danger to the fragile Arctic environment. \nNorway's StatoilHydro had won the right to join in developing the vast \nShtokman gas field. This ended the long uncertainty over one of the world's \n\n\n\nWorld Systems Framework for Oil and Gas Industry \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFIGURE 1.5 \n\nPrivate small-scale \"pecking\" oil well on private land in Oklahoma. \n\n\n\nlargest untapped deposits of oil and gas. Technical challenges abound in \nmany of the exploration fields because they often exhibit diverse topo- \ngraphical, geographical, geological, and environmental properties with far- \nreaching social implications. For this reason, no oil and gas project can be \nundertaken in isolation. World system considerations must be brought to \nbear on all projects, using SoS approaches. The lessons learned from Arctic \nand subarctic operations can serve as starting templates for other projects \naround the world. \n\nA large sinkhole that formed in south Texas's oil and gas region in 2008 is \nan example of the interrelationships of several factors dealing with human \nissues, technology availability, and economic development. The incident \nrenewed questions about the effects of enormous volumes of barrels of \nsaltwater injected into the ground each year as a by-product of oil and gas \ndrilling. High energy prices have led to a surge in drilling across Texas and \nother states, much of it in older oil fields that tend to produce large volumes \nof saltwater along with crude oil. Meanwhile, new technologies for produc- \ning natural gas use millions of gallons of water to crack open gas-bearing \nrocks \u2014 yielding contaminated water that must then be disposed of, usu- \nally underground. This process, called tracking (hydraulic fracturing), has \ngenerated a lot of debate and concerns in many communities. Most notable \nin recent times is the case of tracking in Ohio. Hydraulic fracturing, known \nas tracking for short, involves injecting water, sand, and chemicals deep \ninto the ground at high pressure to crack the shale and allow the oil or \n\n\n\nProject Management for the Oil and Gas Industry \n\n\n\ngas to flow out and be tapped. Some of the opponents of tracking claim \nthat tracking is responsible for the frequent wave of earthquakes in the \nregion. As a part of the overall project development, the full human and \nenvironmental impacts of tracking must be assessed. But at the same time, \nthe economic development impacts must be recognized and factored into \na multiattribute analysis. As energy companies snap up leasing rights in \nWayne County (Ohio), some residents are optimistic, but environmental- \nists are worried. Only a full open-access analysis can allay the fears of all \nstakeholders. \n\nIn 2006, the Texas oil and gas industry injected 6.7 bbo of liquid, mostly \nwater, beneath the ground, and experts say that the amount has been ris- \ning as new wells have multiplied and old wells are revived. Federal regu- \nlators, environmentalists, and community groups worry that lax oversight \nis allowing some of the water \u2014 which can be 10 times as salty as seawa- \nter and often contains oil, heavy metals, and even radioactive material \u2014 to \nescape from underground reservoirs. That could lead to the contamination \nof underground drinking water supplies, the pollution of soil and surface \nwater, and more sinkholes as underground structures are eroded. Critics \nhave argued that project oversights are lax or nonexistent. A comprehensive \nsystems project management approach centered on communication, coop- \neration, and coordination may defuse many of the pending issues. Figure \n1.6 emphasizes the interrelated challenges of energy generation, transmis- \nsion, distribution, and consumption. Figure 1.7 shows an example of natural \ngas flaring, a practice common in some parts of gas-producing developing \ncountries. Figure 1.8 illustrates the mega-sized structures and investments \nassociated with energy ventures. \n\n\n\nFossil \n\nFission \n\nRenewables \n\nFusion \n\n\n\n\nTransmission \ntechnology \n\nHydrogen \n\nDistributed \nenergy resour \n\n\n\nBuildings \n\nIndustry \n\nTransportation \n\n\n\n\nFIGURE 1.6 \n\nInterrelationships of energy generation, transmission, distribution, and consumption. \n\n\n\nWorld Systems Framework for Oil and Gas Industry \n\n\n\n\nFIGURE 1.7 \n\nNatural gas flaring in a developing country. \n\n\n\n\nFIGURE 1.8 \n\nMega structures of oil and gas investments. \n\n\n\n10 \n\n\n\nProject Management for the Oil and Gas Industry \n\n\n\nEnergy Costs \n\nAccording to a report by Pound (2010), in the United States, a state's energy \nportfolio can play a significant role in determining electricity prices. \nFigure 1.9 illustrates the three key factors that determine energy prices. \nThese U.S. averages vary by region and market, depending on the age of the \ninfrastructure and the fuel mix. Some of the least-expensive electricity is \ngenerated by existing coal and nuclear plants. Nonetheless, the cost of elec- \ntricity from new power plants of any type is significantly higher until capital \ncosts are recovered. When a state builds new power plants, it is likely to raise \nrates, regardless of the technology \n\nHigh prices encourage natural gas companies to focus on oil drilling. \nWith oil prices above $100, even the most natural-gas-focused companies \nare increasing their oil drilling in the United States as a way to diversify. \nIn recent years, US. energy companies have concentrated most of their \ndomestic production efforts on natural gas as the biggest, easiest-to-get \ndeposits of domestic crude oil are depleted. Some companies have intensi- \nfied drilling for oil in Colorado and Texas, including in the Barnett Shale, \nwhich has a vast hydrocarbon reserve that had previously been known \nprimarily for gas, not oil. The prices of both commodities have escalated \ndrastically since the beginning of the year. However, the rise for oil has \nbeen steadier than that of gas in recent years. This is because natural \ngas is more difficult to transport and store. It is also more prone to sea- \nsonal fluctuations. Reports indicate that more than 80% of approximately \n1,800 drilling rigs working in the United States in early 2012 were going \nafter gas. Reports also indicate that the number of oil rigs working in the \n\n\n\n\nFIGURE 1.9 \n\nMajor components of U.S. electricity prices (cents per kWh and share of total). (Based on data \nfrom U.S. Energy Information Administration, Annual Energy Outlook, 2010.) \n\n\n\nWorld Systems Framework for Oil and Gas Industry 11 \n\n\n\nUnited States was up 28% from 2011 to 2012 while gas-focused drilling \nrose by 1.4% over the same period. The Marcellus Shale, a layer of rock that \nstretches from upstate New York to eastern Ohio and as far south as West \nVirginia, may be a major source of natural gas in the future. The Marcellus \nShale has been known for more than a century to contain gas, but it was \ngenerally not seen as economical to tap. Recent improvements in recovery \ntechnology, sharply higher natural gas prices, and strong drilling results \nin a similar shale formation in north Texas are changing the playing field \nof oil and gas exploration. It has been confirmed that parts of the country \nwhere energy supplies were long thought to be largely depleted are sud- \ndenly finding a new lease on exploration life cycle. The oil and gas indus- \ntry is already aggressively buying mineral rights in Pennsylvania, where \nthe Marcellus Shale appears to be thickest. It is estimated that more than \n20 oil and gas companies will invest $700 million in 2012 in developing \nthe Marcellus Shale. This bodes well for the application of systems-based \nproject management tools and techniques. Another confirmation of the \ninterconnectedness of markets is the 2012 report linking the sharp rise in \nthe sale of pickup trucks to the increased activities in oil and gas explora- \ntions. Apparently, the caliber of those working or seeking employment \nin the oil and gas industry is in alignment with those who drive pickup \ntrucks. The most likely type of vehicle to be spotted in the parking lot of \noil and gas companies are pickup trucks, which is coveted in that industry \nfor their rugged dependability. \n\n\n\nEducation and Workforce Development Issues \n\nThere is no other industry that is so global and aggressive in educational \nprograms and workforce development as the oil and gas industry. The indus- \ntry itself is large with operational tentacles reaching all parts of the world. \nThe most aggressive nations pursuing oil and gas education and workforce \ndevelopment are the developing nations with newly discovered reserves. \nThe resource-rich developing nations produce more oil and gas graduates \nthan the United States and Europe. This large and steady supply of petro- \nleum graduates from the developing nations is helping to mitigate the over- \nall shortage of technical workforce for the industry. The nations are, thus, \nchipping away at the educational advantage typically held by Western coun- \ntries. Traditionally, the top U.S. schools such as the University of Oklahoma \nand Texas A&amp;M had provided most of the world's petroleum graduates. But \nin recent years, Brazil, Argentina, Nigeria, and other nations are making dra- \nmatic inroads into the production of petroleum graduates. While many of the \nnew graduates are employed by Western oil and gas companies, many are \nalso joining their nation-based companies. A key part of the education and \n\n\n\n12 Project Management for the Oil and Gas Industry \n\n\n\nskills of these foreign nationals should include training in the management \nfields, particularly project management, to buttress their technical assets. \nThe educational infrastructure should be viewed and managed as a part of \nthe overall world system of the oil and gas industry. \n\n\n\nSystem of Systems Framework \n\nThis book advocates using an SoS framework so that all factors of impor- \ntance can be included in the overall design and execution of projects in the \noil and gas industry. \n\n\n\nWhat Is a System? \n\nA system is a collection of interrelated elements working together synergis- \ntically to achieve a set of objectives. The composite output of a system is \ngreater than the sum of the individual outputs of its components. A sys- \ntems view of a process facilitates a comprehensive inclusion of all the factors \ninvolved in the process. \n\n\n\nWhat Is System of Systems? \n\nSoS engineering is an interdisciplinary approach focusing on the synergistic \nintegration of the elements making up a composite complex system, which is \nmade up of other systems. Each subsystem of an SoS is a complete system in \nits own right. Some of the elements of an SoS include \n\n\u2022 Self-regulation \n\n\u2022 Self-adjustment \n\n\u2022 Self-resolution \n\n\u2022 Environmental sensitivity (i.e., interaction with prevailing operating \nconditions) \n\n\u2022 Consolidation of capabilities \n\n\u2022 Coordinated input-process-output relationships \n\n\u2022 Structural interfaces between the systems within the SoS \n\n\u2022 Composite equilibrium of the systems making up the SoS \n\n\u2022 Value trading and transfers between the systems in the overall SoS \n\n\n\nWorld Systems Framework for Oil and Gas Industry 13 \n\n\n\nSoS facilitates an appreciation of what each system brings to the table in the \noverall assessment of the value created by the SoS. The oil and gas industry \nas an SoS, will encompass such elements as the market system, the social sys- \ntem, the environmental system, the national development system, the national \nsecurity system, the economic system, the regulatory system, the legislative \nsystem, the financial services system, and so on. Each of these examples is, \nitself, composed of smaller systems. Taking a world systems view of the oil \nand gas industry ensures that we appreciate all the components and factors \nthat can impinge upon the success or failure of the industry. An SoS approach \ntransforms the individual capabilities of the system entities into a collective \ncapability to meet specific requirements as summarized below: \n\n\u2022 Systems that are individually developed, managed, and operated \nfunction as autonomous components of one or more SoS. \n\n\u2022 All systems within an SoS provide appropriate functional capabili- \nties to each of the other elements in the SoS. \n\n\u2022 The development and management of an SoS explicitly consider the \npolitical, financial, legal, technical, social, organizational, and opera- \ntional characteristics of each element in the SoS. \n\n\u2022 SoS recognizes and embraces the larger pool of stakeholders that \nresults from bringing several systems together. \n\n\u2022 SoS can accommodate changes to its conceptual, functional, physi- \ncal, and spatial operating boundaries without negative impacts on \nits managerial processes. \n\n\u2022 SoS exhibits a collective behavior representing dynamic interactions \nwith the operating environment so that it can adapt and respond to \nmeet or exceed requirements. \n\n\n\nWhat Is a Project System? \n\nAny project is essentially a collection of interrelated activities, people, tech- \nnology, resources, work processes, and other assets brought together in the \npursuit of a common goal. The goal may be in terms of generating one of the \nfollowing: \n\n1. Physical product (e.g., producing a maintenance spanner or a drill \nbit for oil and gas) \n\n2. Service (e.g., providing accounting templates for oil and gas business) \n\n3. Result (e.g., achieving a desired profit margin or meeting oil and gas \nproduction schedule) \n\n\n\n14 \n\n\n\nProject Management for the Oil and Gas Industry \n\n\n\n\nFIGURE 1.10 \n\nWorld systems view of the oil and gas industry. \n\nThus, a systems project management can be defined as follows: \nSystems project management for the oil and gas industry is the process of \nusing a systems approach to manage, allocate, and time resources to achieve \nenterprise-wide goals in an efficient and expeditious manner, considering all \nglobal ramifications. \n\nFigure 1.10 illustrates a world systems view of the several factors and rami- \nfications that affect the oil and gas industry. The most common basis for \nimplementing an SoS view is the application of systems engineering. \n\n\n\nWhat Is Systems Engineering? \n\nSystems engineering is the application of engineering to solutions of a mul- \ntifaceted problem through a systematic collection and integration of parts \nof the problem with respect to the life cycle of the problem. It is the branch \nof engineering concerned with the development, implementation, and use of \nlarge or complex systems. It focuses on specific goals of a system considering \n\n\n\nWorld Systems Framework for Oil and Gas Industry 15 \n\n\n\nthe specifications, prevailing constraints, expected services, possible behav- \niors, and structure of the system. It also involves a consideration of the activi- \nties required to assure that the system's performance matches the stated \ngoals. Systems engineering addresses the integration of tools, people, and \nprocesses required to achieve a cost-effective and timely operation of the \nsystem. \n\n\n\nEmbracing Project Management \n\nThe rapid evolution of technology and environmental sensitivity in a \ndynamic global market creates increasing challenges for those who plan \nand execute oil and gas projects. Thus, project management tools and \ntechniques are essential in the overall scheme of an oil and gas business. \nA coordinated application of systems engineering and project manage- \nment can help increase the bottom line of the oil and gas industry. Systems \nengineering helps to identify an inclusive framework under which all \nthe components would work together. Project management provides \nthe mechanisms through which specific work and objectives within the \nframework would be accomplished. The following project definitions are \nessential: \n\nProject: A project is traditionally defined as a unique one-of-kind endeavor \nwith a specific goal that has a definite beginning and a definite end. The \nProject Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK\u00ae) defines a project as a \ntemporary endeavor undertaken to create a unique product, service, or \nresult. Temporary means having a defined beginning and a definite end. \nThe term \"unique\" implies that the project is different from other projects in \nterms of characteristics. \n\nProject management: Badiru (2012) defines project management as the pro- \ncess of managing, allocating, and timing resources to achieve a given goal in \nan efficient and expeditious manner. \n\nPMBOK defines project management as the application of knowledge, \nskills, tools, and techniques to project activities to achieve project objectives. \n\nIdentification of stakeholders: Stakeholders are individuals or organiza- \ntions whose interests may be positively or negatively impacted by a proj- \nect. Stakeholders must be identified by the project team for every project. \nA common deficiency in this requirement is that employees of the proj- \nect organization are often ignored, neglected, or taken for granted during \nthe identification of stakeholders. As the definition of stakeholders clearly \nsuggests, if the interests of the employees can be positively or negatively \naffected by a project, then the employees must be viewed as stakeholders. \nFor the oil and gas industry, in particular, the local community that can \nbe impacted one way or the other should be included in the list of project \n\n\n\n16 \n\n\n\nProject Management for the Oil and Gas Industry \n\n\n\nstakeholders. A failure to do this adequately is the source of the global \nangst between energy-related industries and local communities around the \nworld. For a successful overall outcome of a project, the local community \nshould be considered as vital as the production staff of the oil and gas \nindustry. A list of stakeholders in an oil and gas project may include all of \nthe following: \n\n\n\nCustomers \n\nProject owner \n\nProject sponsor \n\nProject operator \n\nProject financier \n\nContractors and subcontractors \n\nAssociated companies \n\nLocal communities \n\nProject manager \n\nProject teams \n\nIndustry shareholders \n\n\n\nFigure 1.11 shows a hierarchical structure and interrelationships of some \nof the factors involved in the development of an oil and gas project. With \nan estimated $22 trillion of investment in supply infrastructure in the com- \ning years, there will be recurring opportunities to apply the tools and tech- \nniques of project management. \n\n\n\n\nMachinery Human Materials Financing Reliability Changes \n\n\n\n\n\n\u25a1 \u25a1\u25a1\u25a1 \n\n\n\nFIGURE 1.11 \n\nHierarchical structure of factors in oil and gas project development. \n\n\n\nWorld Systems Framework for Oil and Gas Industry 17 \n\n\n\nThe Gasoline Pump System \n\nSince project management is found everywhere, all project participants will \nfind the systems approach to be very beneficial. A good example of a sys- \ntems design that we are all familiar with is the gas pump. Have you ever \nconsidered all the factors and requirements that go into the operation of a \ngas pump? The pump must exhibit a high level of reliability, dependability, \nand durability as it operates in a wide range of operating conditions, includ- \ning extreme cold in winter and extremely high temperatures in the sum- \nmer. For the pump to operate just right, all factors must interface perfectly \nas expected. The operation of that pump, as we have all come to expect, is \nsimilar to how a good project is supposed to operate. \n\n\n\nQuantitative Systems Modeling \n\nClassical control system focuses on control of the dynamics of mechanical \nobjects, such as a pump, electrical motor, turbine, rotating wheel, and so on. \nThe mathematical basis for such control systems can be adapted (albeit in \niconical formats) for organizational management systems, including project \nmanagement. This is because both technical and managerial systems are \ncharacterized by inputs, variables, processing, control, feedback, and output. \nThis is represented graphically by input-process-output relationship block \ndiagrams. Mathematically, it can be represented as \n\nz=f(x) + e, (1.1) \n\nwhere \nz = output \n\n/(.) = functional relationship \n8 = error component (noise, disturbance, etc.) \n\nFor systems-based multivariable cases, the mathematical expression is rep- \nresented as vector-matrix functions as shown below: \n\nZ = f(X) + E, (1.2) \n\nwhere each term is a matrix. Z is the output vector, f(.) is the input vec- \ntor, and E is the error vector. Regardless of the level or form of mathemat- \nics used, all systems exhibit the same input-process-output characteristics, \neither quantitatively or qualitatively. The premise of this book is that there \nshould be a cohesive coupling of quantitative and qualitative approaches in \n\n\n\n18 \n\n\n\nProject Management for the Oil and Gas Industry \n\n\n\nmanaging a project system. In fact, it is this unique blending of approaches \nthat makes systems application for project management more robust than \nwhat one will find in mechanical control systems, where the focus is primar- \nily on quantitative representations. \n\n\n\nCost-Schedule-Quality Constraints \n\nSystems management is the pursuit of organizational goals within the con- \nstraints of time, cost, and quality expectations. The iron triangle model \ndepicted in Figure 1.12 shows that project accomplishments are constrained \nby the boundaries of quality, schedule, and cost. In this case, quality repre- \nsents the composite collection of project requirements. In a situation where \nprecise optimization is not possible, there will need to be trade-offs between \nthese three factors of success. The concept of iron triangle is that a rigid tri- \nangle of constraints encases the project. Everything must be accomplished \nwithin the boundaries of schedule (time), cost (budget), and quality (per- \nformance requirements). If better quality is expected, a compromise along \nthe axes of time and cost must be executed, thereby altering the shape of the \ntriangle. The trade-off relationships are not linear and must be visualized in \na multidimensional context. This is better articulated by a 3-D view of the \nsystem constraints as shown in the box. Scope requirements determine the \nproject boundary and trade-offs must be done within that boundary. If we \n\n\n\nIron triangle \n\n\n\n\nQuality \n\n\n\nFIGURE 1.12 \n\nProject system constraints of cost, schedule, and quality. \n\n\n\nWorld Systems Framework for Oil and Gas Industry 19 \n\n\n\nlabel the eight corners of the box as (a), (b), (c), . . ., (h), we can iteratively \nassess the best operating point for the project. For example, we can address \nthe following two operational questions: \n\n1. From the point of view of the project sponsor, which corner is the \nmost desired operating point in terms of a combination of require- \nments, time, and cost? \n\n2. From the point of view of the project executor, which corner is the \nmost desired operating point in terms of a combination of require- \nments, time, and cost? \n\nNote that all the corners represent extreme operating points. We notice \nthat point (e) is the do-nothing state, where there are no requirements, \nno time allocation, and no cost incurrence. This cannot be the desired \noperating state of any organization that seeks to remain productive. Point \n(a) represents an extreme case of meeting all the requirements with no \ninvestment of time or cost allocation. This is an unrealistic extreme in any \npractical environment. It represents a case of getting something for noth- \ning. Yet, it is the most desired operating point for the project sponsor. By \ncomparison, point (c) provides the maximum possible for requirements, \ncost, and time. In other words, the highest levels of requirements can be \nmet if the maximum possible time is allowed and the highest possible \nbudget is allocated. This is an unrealistic expectation in any resource- \nconscious organization. You cannot get everything you ask for to execute \na project. Yet, it is the most desired operating point for the project execu- \ntor. Considering the two extreme points of (a) and (c), it is obvious that \nthe project must be executed within some compromise region within the \nscope boundary. \n\n\n\nSystem of Systems Value Modeling \n\nA technique that can be used to assess the overall value-added components \nof a process improvement program is the systems value model (SVM), which \nis an adaptation of the manufacturing system value (MSV) model presented \nby Troxler and Blank (1989). The model provides an analytical decision aid \nfor comparing process alternatives. Value is represented as a p-dimensional \nvector: \n\nV=f(A x ,A 2 A) (1.3) \n\nwhere A = (A v . . ., A\u201e) is a vector of quantitative measures of tangible and \nintangible attributes. Examples of process attributes are quality, throughput, \n\n\n\n20 \n\n\n\nProject Management for the Oil and Gas Industry \n\n\n\ncapability, productivity, cost, and schedule. Attributes are considered to be a \ncombined function of factors, x v expressed as \n\n\n\nink \n\nA k [X\\,x 2 , ...,x,\u201e k ) = y ji\\Xj) \n\n\n\n(1.4) \n\n\n\nwhere {x t } is a set of m factors associated with attribute A k (k = 1,2, . . ., p) and \nfi is a contribution function of factor x, to attribute A k . Examples of factors \ninclude reliability, flexibility, user acceptance, capacity utilization, safety, \nand design functionality. Factors are themselves considered to be composed \nof indicators, c\u201e expressed as \n\n\n\nX,(v u V 2/ ... / V\u201e)= ^Zj{Vj) \n\n\n\n(1.5) \n\n\n\nwhere {v.) is a set of n indicators associated with factor x, (i = 1,2, . . ., m) and z ; \nis a scaling function for each indicator variable v&gt;. Examples of indicators are \nproject responsiveness, lead time, learning curve, and work rejects. By com- \nbining the above definitions, a composite measure of the value of a process \ncan be modeled as \n\nV = f(A 1 ,A 2 A p ) \n\n\n\nf \n\n\n\n(1.6) \n\nwhere m and n may assume different values for each attribute. A subjective \nmeasure to indicate the utility of the decision maker may be included in the \nmodel by using an attribute-weighting factor, w p to obtain a weighted PV: \n\n\n\nmi \n\n\n( n \\ \n\n\n\n\nmj \n\n\n( n \\ \n\n\n\n\nmk \n\n\nf n \\ \n\n\n\n\nX/&lt; \n\n\n^ Z i( V j) \n\n\n/ \n\n\nIfi \n\n\nX 2 '^) \n\n\n, . . . , \n\n\nIf' \n\n\n^ Z i( V i) \n\n\n\n\n! = 1 \n\n\nV H ) \n\n\n-1 \n\n\n;=i \n\n\nV H ) \n\n\n-2 \n\n\n;=i \n\n\nV -'=! ) \n\n\nV , \n\n\n\nPV W =f(w 1 A y w 2 A 2 , . . ., w p A) \n\n\n\n(1.7) \n\n\n\nwhere \n\n\n\n^w k = l, (0&lt;iv k &lt;l) \n\n\n\n(1.8) \n\n\n\nWith this modeling approach, a set of process options can be compared on \nthe basis of a set of attributes and factors. This quantitative approach fits the \nSoS approach perfectly. \n\n\n\nWorld Systems Framework for Oil and Gas Industry 21 \n\n\n\nExample of System Value Modeling \n\nTo illustrate the above modeling approach, suppose three information tech- \nnology (IT) options are to be evaluated based on four attribute elements, \ncapability, suitability, performance, and productivity, as shown in Table 1.1. \n\nFor this example, based on Equations 1.1 and 1.4, the value vector is defined \nas \n\nV =/(capability suitability, performance, productivity) (1.9) \n\nCapability: \"Capability\" refers to the ability of a particular IT technology \nto satisfy multiple requirements. For example, a certain IT equipment may \nonly provide computational service. A different piece of equipment may be \ncapable of generating reports in addition to computational analysis, thus \nincreasing the service variety that can be obtained. The levels of increase in \nservice variety from the three competing equipment types are 38%, 40%, and \n33%, respectively. \n\nSuitability: \"Suitability\" refers to the appropriateness of the IT equipment \nfor current operations. For example, the respective percentages of operating \nscope for which the three options are suitable are 12%, 30%, and 53%. \n\nPerformance: \"Performance,\" in this context, refers to the ability of the IT \nequipment to satisfy schedule and cost requirements. In the example, the \nthree options can, respectively, satisfy requirements on 18%, 28%, and 52% \nof the typical set of jobs. \n\nProductivity: \"Productivity\" can be measured by an assessment of the per- \nformance of the proposed IT equipment to meet workload requirements \nin relation to the existing equipment. For our example, the three options, \nrespectively, show normalized increases of 0.02, -1.0, and -1.1 on a uniform \nscale of productivity measurement. A plot of the histograms of the respec- \ntive \"values\" of the three IT options is shown in Figure 1.13. Option C is the \nbest \"value\" alternative in terms of suitability and performance. Option B \nshows the best capability measure, but its productivity is too low to justify \nthe needed investment. Option A offers the best productivity, but its suit- \nability measure is low. The analytical process can incorporate a lower control \nlimit into the quantitative assessment such that any option providing a value \nbelow that point will not be acceptable. \n\n\n\nTABLE 1.1 \n\nComparison \n\n\nof Information Technology Value Options \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIT Options \n\n\nSuitability \n(fc = l) \n\n\nCapability \n(fc = 2) \n\n\nPerformance \n(fc = 3) \n\n\nProductivity \n(fc = 4) \n\n\nOption A \nOption B \nOption C \n\n\n0.12 \n0.30 \n0.53 \n\n\n0.38 \n0.40 \n0.33 \n\n\n0.18 \n0.28 \n0.52 \n\n\n0.02 \n-1.00 \n-1.10 \n\n\n\n22 \n\n\n\nProject Management for the Oil and Gas Industry \n\n\n\n0.5 \n\n\n\n-0.5 \n\n\n\n-1 \n\n\n\nSuitability Capability Performance Productivity \n\n\n\nhiTTTTT \n\n\n\nABC \n\n\n\nMinimum value target \n\n\n\nABC ABC ABC \n\n\n\nLower control limit \n\n\n\nFIGURE 1.13 \n\nRelative system value weights of three IT options. \n\nThe relative weights used in many justification methodologies are based on \nsubjective propositions of decision makers. Some of those subjective weights \ncan be enhanced by the incorporation of utility models. For example, the \nweights shown in Table 1.1 could be obtained from utility functions. There is \na risk of spending too much time maximizing inputs at \"point-of-sale\" lev- \nels with little time-defining and refining outputs at the \"wholesale\" systems \nlevel. Without a systems view, we cannot be sure whether we are pursuing \nthe right outputs. \n\n\n\nEngineering Project Management \n\nUsing a project structure allows groups to come together to pursue coor- \ndinated engineering innovation in the oil and gas industry. Many of the \ngrand challenges of engineering, compiled by the U.S. National Academy \nof Engineering (NAE) in 2008, have implications for the energy industry. \nThe extract from the NAE document on the 14 grand challenges reads: \"In \nsum, governmental and institutional, political and economic, and personal \nand social barriers will repeatedly arise to impede the pursuit of solutions \nto problems. As they have throughout history, engineers will have to inte- \ngrate their methods and solutions with the goals and desires of all society's \nmembers.\" The above statement emphasizes the relevance of holistic systems \nthinking in problem solving for sustainability solutions. The 14 grand chal- \nlenges are listed below: \n\n1. Make solar energy economical: Solar energy provides less than 1% of \nthe world's total energy, but it has the potential to provide much, \nmuch more. \n\n2. Provide energy from fusion: Human-engineered fusion has been dem- \nonstrated on a small scale. The challenge is to scale up the process \nto commercial proportions, in an efficient, economical, and environ- \nmentally benign way. \n\n\n\nWorld Systems Framework for Oil and Gas Industry 23 \n\n\n\n3. Develop carbon sequestration methods: Engineers are working on ways \nto capture and store excess carbon dioxide to prevent global warming. \n\n4. Manage the nitrogen cycle: Engineers can help restore balance to the \nnitrogen cycle with better fertilization technologies and by captur- \ning and recycling waste. \n\n5. Provide access to clean water: The world's water supplies are facing \nnew threats; affordable, advanced technologies could make a differ- \nence for millions of people around the world. \n\n6. Restore and improve urban infrastructure: Good design and advanced \nmaterials can improve transportation and energy water, and waste \nsystems, and also create more sustainable urban environments. \n\n7.

Engineer the tools of scientific discovery: In the century ahead, engi- \nneers will continue to be partners with scientists in the great quest \nfor understanding many unanswered questions of nature. \n\nWe do not know of any industry that is not touched by these global chal- \nlenges. The oil and gas industry has a direct role to play in all the areas \nlisted because energy is the foundation for accomplishing the goals stated in \nthe grand challenges. This requires the application of project management \ntools and techniques to bring about new products, services, and results effi- \nciently within cost and schedule constraints. Society will be tackling these \ngrand challenges for the foreseeable decades, and project management is one \n\n\n\n24 Project Management for the Oil and Gas Industry \n\n\n\navenue through which we can ensure that the desired products, services, \nand results can be achieved. With the positive outcomes of these projects \nachieved, we can improve the global quality of life. Some of the critical issues \nto address are \n\n\u2022 Strategic implementation plans \n\n\u2022 Strategic communication \n\n\u2022 Knowledge management \n\n\u2022 Evolution of virtual operating environment \n\n\u2022 Structural analysis of projects \n\n\u2022 Analysis of integrative functional areas \n\n\u2022 Project concept mapping \n\n\u2022 Prudent application of technology \n\n\u2022 Scientific control \n\n\u2022 Engineering research and development \n\n\n\nRole of Emerging Nations \n\nLadislaw (2011) documents the roles of rapidly emerging countries in energy \ndevelopment trends around the world. One of the least understood, but \npotentially important, trends in the energy field is how the development pri- \norities of emerging economies are shaping energy markets around the world. \nEmerging economies are expected to make up the bulk of growth in the \ndemand for energy in the coming decades. It is estimated that countries out- \nside the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) \nwill account for more than 80% of the expected demand growth between \n2008 and 2035. Recognized as the global focus of energy expansion, the \nemerging economies will increasingly influence how new energy markets \ndevelop and function. The interrelated commercial frameworks, technology \ndevelopment and sharing, international regulatory developments, and alter- \nnate fuel preferences will dictate how the global system will operate. This \nwill influence how energy companies compete. Project efficiency will form \na key component of the energy market dynamics. Many global energy com- \npanies are developing new exploration and marketing strategies that pay \nattention to the local contents of their operations. This responsive approach \nwill help open up new energy markets in developing nations. The approach \nand contents of this book provide a project systems basis for increasing the \nsuccess and market competitiveness for the oil and gas industry around the \nworld. \n\n\n\nWorld Systems Framework for Oil and Gas Industry 25 \n\n\n\nReferences \n\n\n\nBadiru, A.

(An old West saying for mineral \nprospecting in Western United States) (Dodge, 1941) \n\nFundamentally, there is no business like the oil and gas business. The industry \naffects almost everything else in the general consumer market. The need to \ndevelop practical, efficient, and cost-effective energy infrastructure has never \nbeen more urgent. Developments in solar, wind, nuclear power, biofuels, and \nnew oil and gas technologies have necessitated strategic project management \npractices. The influence sphere of oil and gas has grown dramatically over the \nyears. A big decline in distributor costs of oil and gas directly drives a large \nportion of wholesale prices. Thus, it should be of interest to the general public \nto manage oil and gas projects so as to lower operating costs that can spread \npositively to consumer marketplace. As a demonstration of the influence of the \nindustry, in 2012, Delta Airlines (Reuters, 2012) may have followed the cliche, \n\"If you can't beat them, join them.\" Recognizing that its financial results and \noperating costs are closely tied to fuel prices, the airline decided to bid on an oil \nrefinery. This price hedging approach is expected to be followed by other non- \nenergy-based large corporations in the coming years. Risk is also an inherent \npart of the oil and gas industry. Risk management must be a core component \nof a company's project management portfolio in the oil and gas industry. Risks \ncan be mitigated, but not eliminated. In fact, risk is the essence of any enter- \nprise. In spite of government regulations designed to reduce accident risks in \nthe energy industry, accidents will occasionally happen. Government regula- \ntors can work with oil and gas producers to monitor data and operations. This \nwill only preempt a fraction of potential risks of incidents. For this reason, \nregulators must work with operators to ensure that adequate precautions are \ntaken in all operating scenarios. Government and industry must work together \nin a risk-mitigation partnership, rather than in an adversarial \"lording\" rela- \ntionship. There is no risk-free activity in the oil and gas business. For example, \nmany of the recent petroleum industry accidents involved human elements \u2014 \nerrors, incompetence, negligence, and so on. How do you prevent negligence? \nYou can encourage nonnegligent operation or incentivize perfect record, but \nhuman will still be human when bad things happen. Operators and regulators \nmust build on experiences to map out the path to risk reduction in operations. \nVery few industries spark the sort of mixed sentiments that the oil and \ngas industry experiences. One day, ExxonMobil is hailed as the leader of \nFortune 500 companies in 2012 first quarter earnings (Money, 2012). The next \n\n\n\n27 \n\n\n\n28 Project Management for the Oil and Gas Industry \n\n\n\nday, Mexican Oil Company, Petroleos, faced widespread opposition for the \nproject to drill at extraordinary depths in the Gulf of Mexico (Businessweek, \n2012). On yet another day, British Petroleum (BP) was criticized for the way \nit handled the initial postspill days following the Gulf of Mexico oil spill \naccident, which occurred in April 2010 (BBC, 2012). All the mixed sentiments, \nemotions, and reactions that result have direct impact on the management of \noil and gas projects. \n\nProjects in the oil and gas industry are characterized by huge investments, \nmassive interfaces, and complex engineering endeavors. The size and com- \nplexity of these projects require special attention in the project management \nprocess. Risks are a big part of oil and gas projects. The opening quote in this \nchapter as well as the Latin dictum, \"Spera optimum para pessimum\" \u2014 Hope \nfor the best, prepare for the worst \u2014 provide a fitting platform for approaching \noil and gas projects. Because you never know what you might find (or not find) \nin oil and gas projects, more attention needs to be paid to project planning, \norganization, control, and contingencies. Many aspects of the oil and gas busi- \nness can benefit from better project management practices. The span of proj- \nects of interest in the oil and gas industry includes the selected sample below: \n\nGeneral operations \n\nEconomics of the market \n\nFinancing \n\nProduct marketing \n\nGovernment relations \n\nRegulations \n\nInspections \n\nRegulatory oversight \n\nQuality checks \n\nCompliance assessment \n\nCorporate alliances \n\nHuman resources \n\nHardware and software infrastructure \n\nExploration and development \n\n\u2022 Forecasting \n\n\u2022 Geological research \n\n\u2022 Discoveries \n\n\u2022 Reserves \n\n\u2022 Area drilling \n\n\n\nCharacteristics of Oil and Gas Projects 29 \n\n\n\nDrilling and production \n\n\u2022 Drilling operations \n\n\u2022 Production operations \n\n\u2022 Field start-ups \n\n\u2022 Unconventional resources \n\n\n\nProcessing \n\nRefining \n\nOperations \n\nConstruction \n\nCapabilities \n\nPetrochemicals \n\nGas processing \n\nNew plants \n\nCapacities \n\nLiquefied petroleum gas (LPG) markets \n\nTransportation \n\n\u2022 Tankers \n\n\u2022 Liquefied natural gas (LNG) \n\n\u2022 Pipelines \n\nTo set a backdrop for potential project management scenarios in the oil \nand gas industry, a brief collection of snip-bits in the industry is presented in \nthe sections that follow. \n\n\n\nGovernment Involvement \n\nOne of the operating constraints affecting the oil and gas industry is the typical \ninvolvement of governments of the developing countries. Under national joint \nventure agreements, the government of a developing country may own (or be \ninvolved in) as much as 40% of an oil company. In some cases, a government \nmay seek to have majority ownership. In 2012, in a bold nationalistic move, \nArgentina sought to gain control through majority stake (i.e., &gt;50%) in oil com- \npanies, foreign or domestic, that are operating in the country (Fox News, 2012). \n\n\n\n30 Project Management for the Oil and Gas Industry \n\n\n\nFate of Refineries \n\n\n\nA key fact about the oil business is that the oil industry is at refining capac- \nity, which is more of the reason why prices are so high, and not because \nof shortage of supply of crude. Environmental policy has stifled any new \nconstruction of refineries because of extreme regulatory requirements. Oil \ncompanies have no incentive to build new refineries because this solves a \nnational problem (security, economy, etc.) but is not economically sound for \nthem. They are making money with the current infrastructure and have no \nreason to expand. More research should be directed at reducing the over- \nall risk to the global oil and gas system, considering spatial relationships \nbetween the several factors involved. \n\n\n\nOil Sands Project \n\n\n\nIt was reported in Houston in early 2012 that Koch Oil Sands Operating ULC \nhas received conditional approval to build and operate the Gemini thermal oil \nsands project near Beaverdam in the Cold Lake area of Alberta (OGJ, 2012). The \nprovince's Energy Resources Conservation Board approved a two-stage recov- \nery scheme based on steam-assisted gravity drainage to produce as much as \n10,000 b/d (barrels/day) of bitumen. The first stage includes drilling of a steam \nassisted gravity drainage (SAGD) well pair and two observation wells and con- \nstruction of a processing facility and related pipelines, leading to the production \nof 1200 b/d. The second stage includes drilling of as many as 23 additional well \npairs from five pads and construction of pipelines and a second-stage process- \ning facility, as well as drilling of at least 15 observation wells. The conditions \nset special requirements for groundwater monitoring and for a plan to mitigate \npotential effects on surface water near two of the drilling pads. \n\n\n\nBP to Invest $4 Billion in Gulf of Mexico in 2012 \n\nAt the 2012 Offshore Technology Conference in Houston, Texas, it was \nannounced that BP will invest $4 billion in the Gulf of Mexico in 2012 alone \n(OTC, 2012). This is a massive undertaking that will require massive project \nmanagement operations. \n\nBP PLC has five offshore rigs operating in the Gulf of Mexico, which is \nthe same number as it had before the April 2010 deepwater Macondo well \nblowout. By the year end, BP expects to add three more rigs focused on \n\n\n\nCharacteristics of Oil and Gas Projects 31 \n\n\n\nexploration, appraisal, and developments. BP is investing $4 billion in the \ngulf this year and hopes to invest at least that much every year for the next \ndecade, creating a continuing opportunity for mega applications of proj- \nect management tools and techniques. The Macondo incident prompted a \nfire and explosion on Transocean Ltd.'s Deepwater Horizon semisubmers- \nible drilling rig and a massive oil spill off Louisiana in the Gulf of Mexico. \nIn the Macondo aftermath, BP pressed ahead with its gulf exploration and \ndevelopment and a reinforced focus on risk management. BP currently has \ntwo rigs in operation at Thunder Horse, two at Atlantis, and one at Kaskida. \nOf the three rigs that BP expects to add to the gulf by year end, one of those \nrigs will be equipment brought back to the gulf from West Africa. The big \nnew play is the Palaeogene or Lower Tertiary. In the Gulf of Mexico, this \nincludes BP's discoveries at Kaskida in 2006 and Tiber in 2009. Each of these \nfields has accessible hydrocarbons today, but each also has resources that lie \nbeyond our industry's current limit of 15,000 psi and 275\u00b0F. BP is working to \nincrease its offshore exploration and production capabilities. These efforts \nwill include sensing and monitoring systems for real-time subsea integ- \nrity management. BP is also working with others to develop subsea values, \nweighing 20 tons, capable of closing hydrocarbon flow in seconds. Making \nthis vision a reality will require unprecedented collaboration across and \noutside of the industry \u2014 involving not only operators, vendors, and contrac- \ntors but also academics and regulators, not to mention project management \nprofessionals. This will be necessary to define codes and standards for the \ndesign, operation, and reliability of the new technology. BP is also working \nto become more transparent so it can earn the trust and confidence of the \npublic and the regulators. BP plans to impose higher project standards upon \nits operations, share what it learns, and work together to attract people with \ndifferent skills to the oil and gas industry. The company plans to access the \ndeepest areas of the Gulf of Mexico, and the other great basins of the world. \nThese are projects that call for new techniques of management and control. \n\n\n\nFlak of Fracking \n\nThere are cracks in the acceptance of fracking technology for oil and gas. \nFracking is the industry term for hydraulic fracturing, which is the process \nof injecting water, sand, and chemicals deep into the ground at high pressure \nto crack oil shale so that oil or gas can be harvested or siphoned out. The abil- \nity to cheaply extract gas from shale rock has transformed the global energy \noutlook, but the method of cheap extraction is not generally accepted by \neveryone. Hydraulic fracturing, which was invented by Halliburton in 1947 \n(Halliburton, 2011), is the widening of fractures in a rock layer caused by the \nhigh-pressure injection of chemicals with water. In a hydraulic fracturing job, \n\n\n\n32 Project Management for the Oil and Gas Industry \n\n\n\n\"fracturing fluids\" or \"pumping fluids\" consisting primarily of water and \nsand are injected under high pressure into the producing formation, creat- \ning fissures that allow resources to move freely from rock pores where it \nis trapped. Typically, steel pipe known as surface casing is cemented into \nplace at the uppermost portion of a well for the explicit purpose of protect- \ning the groundwater. The depth of the surface casing is generally determined \nbased on groundwater protection, among other factors. As the well is drilled \ndeeper, additional casing is installed to isolate the formation(s) from which \noil or natural gas is to be produced, which further protects groundwater \nfrom the producing formations in the well. Casing and cementing are critical \nparts of the well construction that not only protect any water zones but are \nalso important to successful oil or natural gas production from hydrocarbon- \nbearing zones. Industry well design practices protect sources of drinking \nwater from the other geologic zone of an oil and natural gas well with multi- \nple layers of impervious rock. While 99.5% of the fluids used consist of water \nand sand, some chemicals are added to improve the flow. The composition of \nthe chemical mixes varies from well to well. \n\nHydraulic fractures form naturally, as in the case of veins or dikes, and \nindustrial fracturing widens or creates fractures to speed up the migration of \ngas and petroleum from source rocks to reservoir rocks. This process is used \nto release petroleum, natural gas (including shale gas, tight gas, and coal seam \ngas), or other substances for extraction, via a technique called induced hydrau- \nlic fracturing, often shortened to tracking or hydrofracking. This type of frac- \nturing, known colloquially as a \"frac job,\" creates fractures from a wellbore \ndrilled into reservoir rock formations. A distinction can be made between low- \nvolume hydraulic fracturing used to stimulate high-permeability reservoirs, \nwhich may consume typically 20,000-80,000 U.S. gallons (76,000-300,000 L; \n17,000-67,000 imp gal) of fluid per well, with high-volume hydraulic frac- \nturing, used in the completion of tight gas and shale gas wells; high-volume \nhydraulic fracturing can use as much as 2-3 million U.S. gallons (7.6-11 ML) \nof fluid per well. This latter practice has come under scrutiny internationally, \nwith some countries suspending or even banning it. The first tracking job was \nperformed in 1947, though the current tracking technique was first used in \nthe late 1990s in the Barnett Shale in Texas. The energy from the injection of \na highly pressurized tracking fluid creates new channels in the rock, which \ncan increase the extraction rates and, ultimately, permit the recovery of fossil \nfuels. According to the International Energy Agency, the global use of natural \ngas will rise by more than 50% compared to 2010 levels, and account for over \n25% of world energy demand in 2035. Proponents of tracking point to the \nvast amounts of formerly inaccessible hydrocarbons the process can extract. \nHowever, there remain large uncertainties in the amount of gas reserves \nthat can be accessed in this way. Detractors point to potential environmen- \ntal impacts, including contamination of ground water, risks to air quality, the \nmigration of gases and hydraulic fracturing chemicals to the surface, surface \ncontamination from spills and flow back, and the health effects of these. \n\n\n\nCharacteristics of Oil and Gas Projects 33 \n\n\n\nRules, Laws, Regulations, and Standards \n\nFew industries are as subject to a multitude of rules, laws, regulations, and \nstandards as the oil and gas industry. Standards provide a common basis for \nglobal commerce. Without standards, product compatibility, customer satis- \nfaction, and production efficiency cannot be achieved. Just as quality cannot \nbe achieved overnight, compliance with standards cannot be accomplished \ninstantaneously. The process must be developed and incorporated into regu- \nlar operating procedures over a period of time. Standards define the critical \nelements that must be taken into consideration to produce a high-quality prod- \nuct that meets customers' expectations. Each organization must then develop \nthe best strategy to address the elements. Both regulatory and consensus \nstandards must be taken into account when executing oil and gas projects. \nRegulatory standards refer to standards that are imposed by a governing body, \nsuch as a government agency. All firms within the jurisdiction of the agency \nare required to comply with the prevailing regulatory standards. Consensus \nstandards refer to a general and mutual agreement among a group of compa- \nnies to abide by a set of self-imposed standards. Industry alliances, such as \nOPEC, impose their own consensus standards and rules on themselves. There \nmay also be contractual standards, which are imposed by the customer based on \ncase-by-case or order-by-order needs. Most international standards will fall in \nthe category of consensus. A lack of international agreements often leads to \ntrade barriers by nations, industries, and special interest groups. \n\nIn response to the widespread expressions of concerns about tracking, the \nU.S. government, the Environment Protection Agency (EPA), in April 2012 \nissued new regulations to govern tracking (EPA, 2012). \n\nThe standards are to control air pollution from gas wells that are drilled \nusing tracking. The government strongly supports natural gas drilling as a \nclean source of energy and wanted to ensure coordination to ease the pro- \nduction burden on the oil and gas industry. EPA maintains that the new \nregulations would ensure pollution is controlled without slowing natural \ngas production. Much of the air pollution from tracked gas wells is vented \nwhen the well transitions from drilling to actual production. This is a 3-10- \nday process, which is referred to as \"completion.\" An earlier version of the \nrule limiting air pollution from gas wells would have required companies \nto install pollution-reducing equipment immediately. Under the new rules, \ndrillers will now be given more than 2 years to employ technology to reduce \nemissions of smog and soot-forming pollutants during that stage. EPA would \nrequire drillers to burn off gas in the meantime. This is an alternative that can \nrelease smog-forming nitrogen oxides, but will still reduce overall emissions. \nThis is a good example of where a systems view is instrumental because as \none hole is plugged at one end, some other issue may develop at the other end. \nThe oil and gas industry must consider these new rules as well as other pro- \nduction and economic considerations into their overall project management \n\n\n\n34 \n\n\n\nProject Management for the Oil and Gas Industry \n\n\n\n\nFIGURE 2.1 \n\nSchematic of a typical tracking structure. \n\nstrategies. About 25,000 wells a year undergo tracking in the United States. \nFigure 2.1 shows a typical schematic drawing of a tracking structure. \n\n\n\nKeystone Oil Pipeline \n\nThe Keystone Pipeline System is a 1700-mile, $7-billion pipeline system \nto transport synthetic crude oil and diluted bitumen (\"dilbit\") from the \nAthabasca Oil Sands in northeastern Alberta, Canada to multiple destina- \ntions in the United States, which include refineries in Illinois, the Cushing oil \ndistribution hub in Oklahoma, and proposed connections to refineries and \nexport terminals along the Gulf Coast of Texas (Guardian, 2012). It consists \nof the operational \"Keystone Pipeline\" (Phase 1) and \"Keystone-Cushing \nExtension\" (Phase 2), and two proposed Keystone XL pipeline expansion seg- \nments. After the Keystone XL pipeline segments are completed, American \ncrude oil would enter the XL pipelines at Baker, Montana and Cushing, \nOklahoma. The Keystone XL has faced lawsuits from oil refineries and criti- \ncism from environmentalists and some members of the U.S. Congress. The \nU.S. Department of State in 2010 extended the deadline for federal agencies \nto decide if the pipeline is in the national interest, and in November 2011, \nPresident Obama postponed the decision until 2013. The U.S. government \nblocked the pipeline in early 2012, citing uncertainty over the Nebraska route, \nwhich would travel above an aquifer that provides water to eight states. In \nApril 2012, Calgary-based TransCanada, the company planning the Keystone \nXL oil pipeline, proposed a new route through Nebraska that would avoid the \n\n\n\nCharacteristics of Oil and Gas Projects 35 \n\n\n\nstate's environmentally sensitive Sandhills region. In addition to the U.S. EPA, \nthe State Department is also involved because the pipeline would cross a U.S. \nborder. The twists and turns of the diverse involvement in oil and gas projects \nrequire extraordinary systems-based project management techniques. \n\n\n\nNew Projects, New Project Management Opportunities \n\nIn April 2012, it was announced (Akers Solutions, 2012) that Statoil has issued \na contract to Aker Solutions to hire a category B drilling rig, a new type of \nrig, which is designed to increase recovery from the company's operating \nfields on the Norwegian continental shelf (NCS). Statoil has developed the \nnew type of rig and well control system in cooperation with the supplier \nindustry. The category B rig, which falls between light intervention vessels \n(category A) and conventional rigs (category C), has been specially adapted \nto carry out well intervention and drilling operations in existing subsea \nwells. The new rig, with associated integrated services, is expected to reduce \noperating costs for well intervention by as much as 40%, Statoil reported. \nThe rig's design provides the option for a number of different types of well \ninterventions using wireline and coiled tubing operations. The rig type is \ndesigned for year-round well service in Statoil-operated activities. This type \nof rig is also designed to carry out sidetrack drilling from production tubing \n(through tubing drilling) in a manner that allows simultaneous production \nfrom both the new sidetrack and existing production tubing. The well ser- \nvices are conducted through existing subsea network. The key to maintaining \nthe current production level on the NCS is increased recovery from existing \nfields, along with the development of new fields. Increasing drilling activity \non mature fields is important in order to achieve the NCS's full potential. In \n2011, Statoil operated about 500 subsea wells. Statoil and licensees will enter \ninto an 8-year contract with options for three times 2 years for the category \nB service. The estimated value of the contract is $1.9 billion. In addition to \nrig rental, the contract also includes rental of the necessary equipment and \nservices to carry out well intervention, sidetrack drilling, remotely operated \nvehicle operations, well testing, and cementing. If project management goes \nwell, the rig will be in operation by 2015. \n\n\n\nGas Export Project Management \n\nIn February 2012, Kuwait Gulf Oil Co. let a contract to the Penspen Group \n(Penspen, 2012) for the project management and detailed design and \n\n\n\n36 Project Management for the Oil and Gas Industry \n\n\n\nconstruction of a natural gas and condensate export system (GCES) from \nKhafji, Saudi Arabia, on the Kuwait-Saudi border, to Kuwait. Penspen \nwill manage engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) contractor \nTechnip. The new export system will carry 40 MMcfd of gas via 110 km of \n12-in.-OD export pipeline, of which about 47 km will be offshore. Penspen \nwill oversee Technip's detailed design work, procurement activities, and \nconstruction undertaken by Technip and its subcontractors. Penspen will \nalso assist with commissioning the final scheme. GCES will deliver conden- \nsate and gas product to Kuwait from Saudi Arabia, reducing gas flaring in \nthe process. Technip's operating center in Abu Dhabi will execute the proj- \nect, scheduled to be completed by the second half of 2014. DLB Comanche, \nwhich entered the Technip fleet with the acquisition of Global Industries, \nwill complete offshore operations. \n\n\n\nCase Example of Shell's Use of PMBOK \n\nIn May 2001, Shell International Exploration and Production Inc. reported \nthe successful use of structured project management on their Brutus project, \na deepwater tension leg platform (Shell, 2012). The company used new proj- \nect management tactics based on the contents of the Project Management \nInstitute (PMI)'s PMBOK, a standardization guideline established by the \nPMI. Standardization is needed as various elements of the offshore energy \nindustry need a common language and common operating procedures so \nthat they can better communicate with each other on complex deepwater \nprojects. The procedures developed for the Brutus project were grouped \nand aligned in accordance with the PMBOK. A standardized work break- \ndown structure and a new financial software system are just two examples \nof new project management tactics used in the project. The approach gave \nteam members new insights into achieving the objectives and reinforced \nthe basic principles of project management. Customer expectations were \nexceeded and efficiency improved. Future project teams can achieve benefits \nby similarly organizing their project management processes. Shell opined \nthat projects must be able to stand on their own financially and be capable \nof paying their own bills. Cash flow is essential in project finance. People \nbehave as rewarded. Consequently, it is suggested that organizations should \ntie the cash flow to the performance desired and people will respond posi- \ntively. Deepwater projects are particularly costly and of high risk. Project \nmanagement tactics help companies gauge the accuracy of estimates for time \nand cost projections, Shell concluded. Project risk is often mismanaged. If \nprojects are approved based on anticipated return on investment (ROI) with \nminimal analysis of risk, a project is set up for failure. Decisions based on \nincomplete information will be faulty during project execution. \n\n\n\nCharacteristics of Oil and Gas Projects 37 \n\n\n\nHail to Project Management \n\nIn a 2003 industry study/ owners of downstream petroleum and chemical \ncompanies ranked project management capability as the main consider- \nation in choosing engineering contractors. The owners had concerns about \nthe viability of contracting companies and the supply of reliable engineer- \ning resources. These were some of the conclusions of a biennial survey of \nthe global downstream EPC industry by Transmar Consult Inc., Houston in \n2003. The study designated seven engineering contractors as leading firms \nin executing projects: Bechtel Corp., Fluor Corp., Jacobs Engineering Group \nInc., JGC Corp., KBR, Snamprogetti SPA, and Technip-Coflexip. \n\n\n\nProject Management Improve Operations \n\nIn 2000, Transocean Sedco Forex Inc.'s Discoverer Deep Seas utilized mod- \nern project management techniques to shorten cycle time and improve \nworkflow procedures in dual-activity drillship operations. The Discoverer \nDeep Seas began work in the Gulf of Mexico in the fourth quarter 2000. \nIt held a 5-year contract with Chevron Inc. at an estimated day rate of \n$205,000. After this vessel, only one drillship remains in the 3-year old \ndrillship construction cycle. This ultra deep water vessel, which used a \ndual-activity design pioneered by the Discoverer Enterprise was delivered \nin the fourth quarter of 2000. \n\n\n\nTechnology Project Management \n\nTechnology project management reportedly improved multiwell shallow \ngas development in 1995, according to a presentation by Becker Husky Oil \nOperations Ltd. in Calgary, Canada (Becker, 1995). Because of time and eco- \nnomic constraints, a multiwell shallow gas development project in south- \neastern Alberta required thorough prejob planning and special drilling, \ncementing, and completions designs. The project took place during a period \nof peak industry activity, putting extra challenges on logistics and services. \nThe Medicine Hat shallow gas project, undertaken by Husky Oil Operations \nLtd. in mid-1994, was a high-volume, short-time frame, and economically \ntight project schedule. But using technology project management techniques, \nthe project came through on time and within budget. \n\n\n\nhttp://www.ieej.or.jp/aperc/pdf/downstream_study.pdf \n\n\n\n38 Project Management for the Oil and Gas Industry \n\n\n\nProject Management Improves Well Control Events \n\nA 1995 report presented by Garold D. Oberlender (Oklahoma State University, \nStillwater, Oklahoma) and L. William Abel (Wild Well Control Inc., Spring, \nTexas) is recounted here to illustrate how project management improved \noil well control events (Oberlender and Abel, 1995). During a well control \noperation, the efficient use of personnel and equipment, through good proj- \nect management techniques, contributes to increased safety and ensures a \nquality project. The key to a successful blowout control project is to use all \nresources in the most efficient manner. Excessive use of resources leads to \nunnecessary expenditures and delays in bringing the project under control. \n\nEffective project management techniques are critical for complex, schedule- \nintensive, well control projects. In a well control situation, information must \nbe gathered and organized in a systematic manner so that good decisions can \nbe made at the right time. A project team must be organized, and all efforts \nmust be coordinated to focus on the common goal of completing the project \nefficiently. Project management is a process of orderly management of numer- \nous tasks that must be accomplished simultaneously. Project management is \ndefined as the art and science of coordinating people, equipment, materials, \nmoney, and schedules to complete a specified project on time and within \napproved costs. Project management techniques have steadily improved in \nthe last 40 years. In the 1950s, formal techniques, such as the critical path \nmethod (CPM), were developed for managing large complex engineering \nand construction projects for the petrochemical industry. In the 1960s, com- \nputer automation of many project management techniques became possible, \nwith sophisticated tracking models developed for controlling the progress of \nprojects. In the 1980s, the introduction of personal computers provided even \nmore access to automated project management techniques to allow planning, \nscheduling, monitoring, and controlling of work in a real-time environment. \n\nLessons learned from the practice of good project management can be \napplied to wild well projects. In such emergency situations, the schedule of \nthe project usually takes priority over all other considerations. Therefore, the \nability to monitor progress carefully in a real-time environment is extremely \nimportant to controlling the project. Information must be gathered, orga- \nnized, and given to the right person at the right time so good decisions can \nbe made under adverse conditions. Well control projects have various levels \nof complexity, and as the complexity increases, the need for a project man- \nagement approach becomes more important. \n\nSeveral complicated and difficult well control projects occurred in the \n1980s, and the cost to control these wells exceeded $200 million each. Many \nexperienced individuals in any business will readily agree that a $200 mil- \nlion project justifies the use of advanced project management techniques to \ncontrol and guide the efforts of all parties and ensure a successful outcome. \n\n\n\nCharacteristics of Oil and Gas Projects 39 \n\n\n\nSeveral of these multimillion dollar projects, however, were run without \nproper planning and with little or no application of a formal system of proj- \nect management. The lack of good project management principles caused \ninefficiencies, delays, and higher costs. \n\nThe Kuwait well control project, which involved more than 700 blowouts, \nwas accomplished in a much shorter time (8 months) than first estimated \n(5 years). This improvement partly resulted from the application of sound \nproject management techniques. These projects were prime examples of the \nneed for a formal project management approach to handling wild well proj- \nects. There are many examples of projects that were successful in controlling \nwells but were economic disasters. Only through the effective application \nof project management can complex well control projects be completed in \nreasonable time frames at reasonable cost. \n\nTeam Management \n\nTo be effective, a project team must be able to make things happen, which is \nbest accomplished by maintaining a \"Can do\" attitude and working together \nas an integrated team. Effective teamwork is mandatory for bringing any \nwild well under control. \n\nThe first step in organizing the team is selection of the project manager \nwho is assigned full responsibility for all aspects of the project. This indi- \nvidual must have knowledge and experience in dealing with well control \nprojects. Most importantly, he must be given the authority to make decisions \nand to act as the sole coordinator of all activities. \n\nBecause the project manager must focus his full attention on the wild well, \nhe must not be involved in any other work that may distract his attention and \nconcentration. \n\nThe first task of the project manager is to assess the condition of the well \nto determine viable options for bringing it under control. This task is best \ndone if a proper contingency plan is already in place, providing for rapid \ndeployment of predetermined action plans. The project manager must also \nestablish proper communication channels with all appropriate authorities. \nHe must have both a thorough knowledge of well control projects and effec- \ntive management skills. \n\nBecause each wild well event is unique, the project team must be assem- \nbled, organized, and managed for the particular conditions at the well loca- \ntion. The project manager must assemble a team of people who have the right \ntechnical expertise to handle the job. He must be the leader of the team of \nindividuals with diverse backgrounds and with special expertise to handle \nany problems that arise. Although a formal system of handling the project \nis needed, it is people that make things happen, and these people must have \nthe ability to detect problems, make adjustments to the system, and make the \nright decisions at the right time. \n\n\n\n40 Project Management for the Oil and Gas Industry \n\n\n\nProject Scope \n\nAlthough each wild well control project is unique, a well-managed project \ngenerally follows this sequence: \n\n\u2022 The team must define the scope of what must be accomplished, \nincluding giving priorities to tasks, identifying equipment and spe- \ncial expertise, and setting expected levels of quality, safety require- \nments, and reliability of operations. \n\n\u2022 Although budget is often not a controlling factor in well control proj- \nects, eventually the allocation and responsibility of cost expendi- \ntures must be addressed, including budgeting each task in the scope \ndefinition. \n\n\u2022 A strategy must be set for accomplishing the tasks. It is important to \nanticipate all events and to build contingency plans into the project \nfor the unexpected deviations that often occur. \n\n\u2022 A timetable must be made for the planned work to ensure an inte- \ngrated sequence of all tasks. \n\n\u2022 A tracking system must be developed to ensure the project pro- \ngresses as planned, by measuring actual work done versus the \nschedule. \n\n\u2022 The project should be closed out, which includes verification that \nall required tasks have been completed to ensure the project is in a \nstable condition and completed at an acceptable level of quality. \n\nThese steps represent project management in its simplest form. In practice, \nthere is considerable overlap in the sequences because there are many parties \ninvolved, and the work of one may affect the work of others. Thus, extensive \ncoordination is required. Most existing project management literature deals \nwith engineering design, construction, or manufacturing work and not with \nwild well control projects. The issues that are discussed generally focus on \nexpediting the work in a schedule-compressed mode, similar to a fast-track \nconstruction project. Thus, the basic principles of project management apply \nto schedule-driven wild well control projects. The most important task for \nany project is to define the scope of work. A fundamental principle of proj- \nect management is that any project, regardless of its size or type, consists of \nthree components: scope, budget, and schedule. Each of these components \nmust be described in detail and linked to the others. For example, as the \nscope of work increases, the cost and time to do the work will also increase. \nDefining the project scope must precede defining the budget or schedule. \n\nIn a wild well project, the overall objective is to extinguish the fire and bring \nthe well under control. Other objectives, however, may also be extremely \nimportant. For example, the objectives may include controlling the well in a \nway that allows drilling operations to resume so the well can eventually be \n\n\n\nCharacteristics of Oil and Gas Projects 41 \n\n\n\nproduced rather than abandoned. In construction projects, the emphasis is \ntoo often incorrectly placed on budget and schedule and not on the scope or \nquality of work. In well control projects, there may be excessive emphasis on \nschedule and on controlling the well as quickly as possible without regard to \nthe impact on budget, scope, or quality. Because of the nature of well control \nprojects and the pressures to achieve a quick solution, it is often difficult to \nmanage the project efficiently. Careful planning beforehand will provide a \nworkable and rational solution for the operations group. \n\nThe well control company is best suited to be involved in the design and \nimplementation of the control operation, provided its personnel have the \nskill and capabilities to perform project management duties. If the well con- \ntrol company has engineering expertise that is fully integrated in its field \noperations, they will be best suited for overall coordination and manage- \nment of the project. Regardless of the type of well control project, there must \nbe a single project manager who is responsible for coordinating all aspects \nof the project. The project manager is responsible for reporting to the opera- \ntor or team with complete responsibility and authority for making decisions. \nThe most successful well control projects have been completed by a compe- \ntent project manager who had the technical expertise and the management \nskills necessary to ensure the work was performed as and when needed. \nCommittees, with a group acting as a project manager, tend to have slow \ndecision making and be bureaucratic. \n\nIn well control project management, four fundamental questions must be \naddressed: Who is going to do it? What are they going to do? When are they \ngoing to do it? And, how much is it going to cost? A lack of an answer to \nany of these questions during the project will usually result in additional \nproblems. The most important skill the project manager must possess is \nthe ability to be an effective communicator. Regardless of his abilities as an \nengineer or manager, he will be ineffective if he lacks communication skills. \nThe project manager must have the technical knowledge of what needs to \nbe done and the ability to communicate that knowledge to others. To bring a \nblowout under control, many different types of expertise are required. Thus, \nthe project manager must have the ability to delegate authority and respon- \nsibility to the specialists involved so he can concentrate on the overall project \nobjectives. The central axiom for project management is to organize the proj- \nect around the work to be done rather than trying to force events to fit some \npredetermined organization. \n\nOrganizational Structures \n\nRegardless of the type of management organization chosen for a well control \nevent, the main consideration must be a bias for action. The management \ngroup must focus on five major functions: planning, organizing resources, \nselecting staff, coordinating work, and controlling the operation. Each well \ncontrol project is unique and requires a suitable choice of organizational \n\n\n\n42 Project Management for the Oil and Gas Industry \n\n\n\nstructure, the most common of which are discipline, functional, and matrix \norganizations. In a discipline-oriented organization, personnel who share the \nsame technical expertise are placed in common departments. For example, \nall civil engineering expertise is located in the civil engineering department, \nand so on. A functional organization places individuals in departments that \nfocus on specific processes, such as reservoir engineering, production engi- \nneering, or drilling and completion. \n\nThe matrix organization places overall management responsibilities in \na management group. The management group obtains technical expertise \nfrom the various departments in the company and, if necessary, secures \nassistance from sources outside of the company. The most desirable orga- \nnizational structure for a well control event depends on numerous factors, \nincluding the severity and complexity of the event and the availability of \ntechnical expertise. For routine projects, either the discipline or functional \napproach may be suitable. For a complex and technically difficult project, the \nmatrix organization is preferable. The two structures recommended for well \ncontrol events are the functional and matrix organizations. The functional \norganization disperses the disciplines among the departments in a company. \nProject teams are formed within the departmental group. Management is \nusually accomplished by the team leader or project manager, who also is a \nmember of the department. \n\nOn occasion, a drilling department may be called upon to function in the \nrole of project manager to oversee the blowout control event. This arrange- \nment may be acceptable for smaller, more routine projects but can present \nsome problems in dealing effectively with a major event. A common error in \nthe management of well control projects is to attempt to direct the work from \nwithin a departmental group, which retains all of its existing responsibilities. \nThis method dilutes the efforts of the project manager, and one or more of his \nprojects will suffer as a result. Well control events should be managed by a \nsingle person who has no other priorities or responsibilities, a person who can \nfocus his attention exclusively on the complex process of controlling the well. \n\nThe matrix organization increases the importance of managing cost and \nschedule and maintaining the general balance among all the elements of the \nproject. A separate project management organization directs the job, with the \nsupport of technical expertise from the discipline departments. The objective \nis to keep the disciplines in their home environments where they function \nbest, while making their expertise available to meet the needs of the project. \nThe matrix organization requires two lines of communication: one to the disci- \npline organization and the other to the project organization. A discipline man- \nager answers any specific questions. Issues related to the project are addressed \nby the project manager. In the matrix organization, the project manager coor- \ndinates all aspects of the well control project. Each discipline is responsible for \nits portion of the project, such as quality, cost, or schedule. \n\nMatrix organizations can be strong or weak. In a strong matrix, the project \nmanager has the authority to decide what is best overall for the project. In a \n\n\n\nCharacteristics of Oil and Gas Projects 43 \n\n\n\nweak matrix, the discipline group has the authority to make decisions for the \nproject. The success of the matrix organization is highly dependent on the \ncompany's philosophy and even more so on the attitude of the employees \ninvolved. If discipline managers are more concerned about their discipline \nthan the project, the project can have inefficiencies and delays. A key to a \nsuccessful project is a balance between the technical expertise of the disci- \npline departments and the project management group. Technical personnel \ngenerally concentrate on producing the best product possible, often without \nregard to cost or schedule. In a well control project, quality and schedule \ngenerally take priority, although cost is always an important consideration. \n\nScheduling \n\nPlanning, measuring, evaluating, forecasting, and controlling are the key \nresponsibilities of the project management team. All aspects of the project \nmust be tracked and managed to ensure effective control of the project. \nTracking cannot take place unless a well-defined work plan, budget, and \nschedule have been developed. Planning should precede project scheduling. \nFor the entire well control project, there must be an explicit operational plan \nthat binds scope, budget, and schedule. A common error of planning is to \nconcentrate solely on schedule and disregard the importance of scope and \nbudget. The following are the key principles of planning: \n\n\u2022 Begin planning before the start of work, not after. \n\n\u2022 The people who will actually do the work should be involved in \nplanning and scheduling from the onset. \n\n\u2022 The plan must give balanced consideration to the aspects of scope, \nbudget, schedule, and quality. \n\n\u2022 The plan should be flexible, including allowances for respond- \ning to unexpected changes and with time allotted for review and \napprovals. \n\n\u2022 The plan must be kept simple and without irrelevant details that \nprevent readability. \n\n\u2022 The plan should be distributed to and understood by all parties \ninvolved. \n\nTracking Models \n\nPlanning is the first step in project scheduling, but tracking is equally essen- \ntial. Tracking cannot detect deviations unless there is a master plan or sched- \nule against which to compare actual progress. The size, complexity, duration, \nand importance of the well control project dictate the technique used for proj- \nect scheduling. The tracking model must be functional and easy to use. Two \nmethods meet these criteria: bar charts (sometimes called Gantt charts) and the \n\n\n\n44 Project Management for the Oil and Gas Industry \n\n\n\nCPM. Because bar charts are simple and easy to interpret, they are usable by all \nparticipants in a project. Bar charts have three drawbacks: They do not show \ninterdependency of activities; they require considerable time for updating; and \nthey do not integrate costs or resources. A common complaint about Gantt \ncharts is the high level of effort required to keep the charts updated. A signifi- \ncant amount of labor and time must be expended in keeping the charts current \nbecause of constantly changing conditions, such as man-hour requirements. \n\nCritical Path Method \n\nBoth the CPM and the program evaluation and review technique (PERT) \nare often referred to as network analysis systems. CPM takes a determinis- \ntic approach, which assigns a single duration to each activity in the network, \nwhereas PERT is a probabilistic approach that deals with three possible times \nfor each activity (optimistic, pessimistic, and normal). Experience with fast track \nprojects, such as blowouts, has shown CPM to be the preferred method. CPM \nforces the project team to direct all efforts to a single start date to kick off the \nproject and a single completion date to bring the project under control. Both \nGantt charts and CPM are suitable for well control projects. The Gantt charts are \nbest suited for situations involving activities that do not have significant inter- \ndependencies with other activities (such as design work and public relations). \n\nThe CPM method is a preferred approach for planning and scheduling \nmore complex well control projects, situations in which activities are highly \ninterdependent, or where there is a need to track resources assigned to the \nproject. CPM uses a network diagram to model the interdependencies of \nactivities. CPM forces the project team to divide the work into definable \nunits and to determine how work items interface with each other. A well- \ndefined work breakdown structure (which shows the primary and second- \nary responsibilities for each member of the well control team) will greatly \nsimplify the task of generating the CPM network diagram. \n\nMany project managers use precedence diagrams for well control that only \nshows major events; the numerical coding system, activity duration, and \nresources have been omitted to simplify the illustration. These diagrams \nrequire fewer activities to describe the project and have great flexibility in \nsequencing activities and showing relationships between them. CPM has \nadapted computer-aided techniques to automate calculations for schedul- \ning and the graphic printout of network diagrams. The use of computers in \nCPM allows modeling of man-hours, costs, and duration to closely monitor \nwork progress and produce a variety of project management reports. \n\nDecision Trees \n\nWell control events are unique projects that require quick decisions for criti- \ncal problems to be solved expeditiously. The project manager must be able \nto \"think on his feet\" and react to emergency situations in adverse working \n\n\n\nCharacteristics of Oil and Gas Projects 45 \n\n\n\nconditions, especially during kill operations. Contingency planning for likely \nscenarios is essential to increase the probability of success. Decision trees are \nuseful to help the project manager run the job. \n\nThe snip-bits presented above represent just a sample of the thousands of \nproject-related events, issues, and developments in the oil and gas industry. \nAs can be seen, there are tremendous areas of need for project management \nin the industry. The chapters that follow will address specific tools, tech- \nniques, and concepts of project management as relevant for applications in \nthe oil and gas industry. The framework used in the contents that follow \ncenter around the following knowledge areas: \n\n\u2022 Managerial processes \n\n\u2022 Technical systems \n\n\u2022 Human interfaces \n\n\u2022 Systems engineering \n\nBoth quantitative and qualitative aspects of project management are cov- \nered to the extent that they can benefit researchers, educators, students, and \npractitioners as reference materials. \n\n\n\nOil Bunkering in Developing Nations \n\nThe so-called oil bunkering occurs when thieves tap into an oil pipeline. The \nculprits either sell the oil or produce poorly refined petroleum products that \nare sold on the black market. This practice is very common in impoverished \ncommunities in developing countries and it has grave adverse impacts on \nthe country's oil industry. The danger of explosion posed by the illegal activ- \nity creates difficulties in executing pipeline projects. The cost and time impli- \ncations of dealing with the aftermaths of oil bunkering translate to schedule \ninconveniences as well as project execution disruptions. \n\n\n\nReferences \n\n\n\nAkers Solutions. 2012. http://www.akersolutions.com/en/Global-menu/Media/ \nPress-Releases/ All/ 2012/ Aker-Solutions-and-Statoil-awarded-ONS- \nInnovation-Award/, accessed April 25, 2012. \n\nBBC. 2012. http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-10656239, accessed May \n5, 2012. \n\n\n\n46 Project Management for the Oil and Gas Industry \n\n\n\nBecker, D.

With the diversity of markets globally, project integration is of great \nconcern. Using a consistent body of knowledge can alleviate the potential \nproblems faced in the project environment. Projects in the oil and gas indus- \ntry are particularly complex and dynamic, thus necessitating a consistent \napproach. The use of project management continues to grow rapidly The \nneed to develop effective management tools increases with the increasing \ncomplexity of new technologies and processes. The life cycle of a new prod- \nuct to be introduced into a competitive market is a good example of a com- \nplex process that must be managed with integrative project management \napproaches. The product will encounter management functions as it goes \nfrom one stage to the next. Project management will be needed throughout \nthe design and production stages of the product. Project management will \nbe needed in developing marketing, transportation, and delivery strategies \nfor the product. When the product finally gets to the customer, project man- \nagement will be needed to integrate its use with those of other products \nwithin the customer's organization. The need for a project management \napproach is established by the fact that a project will always tend to increase \nin size even if its scope is narrowing. The following four literary laws are \napplicable to any project environment: \n\nParkinson's law: Work expands to fill the available time or space. \n\nPeter's principle: People rise to the level of their incompetence. \n\nMurphy's law: Whatever can go wrong will. \n\nBadiru's rule: The grass is always greener where you most need it to be \ndead. \n\nAn integrated systems project management approach can help diminish \nthe adverse impacts of these laws through good project planning, organiz- \ning, scheduling, and control. The Project Management Institute, as a way \nof promoting a common language for the practice of project management, \ndeveloped the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK), which \nhas been widely adopted around the world. \n\n\n\n47 \n\n\n\n48 Project Management for the Oil and Gas Industry \n\n\n\nProject Management Knowledge Areas \n\nThe nine knowledge areas presented in the PMBOK are listed below: \n\n1.

PMBOK \ndefines a project as a temporary endeavor undertaken to create a unique \n\n\n\n50 Project Management for the Oil and Gas Industry \n\n\n\nproduct, service, or result. Temporary means having a defined beginning \nand a definite end. The term \"unique\" implies that the project is different \nfrom other projects in terms of characteristics. \n\nProject Management \n\nThis author defines project management as the process of managing, allocat- \ning, and timing resources to achieve a given goal in an efficient and expedi- \ntious manner. \n\nPMBOK defines project management as the application of knowledge, \nskills, tools, and techniques to project activities to achieve project objectives. \n\nOther sources define project management as the collection of skills, tools, \nand management processes essential for executing a project successfully. \n\nProject Management Methodology \n\nA project management methodology defines a process that a project team uses \nin executing a project, from planning through phase-out. Figure 3.1 presents \ngeneral framework for cross-functional application of the project management \nmethodology. People, process, and technology assets (science and engineer- \ning) form the basis for implementing organizational goals. Human resources \nconstitute crucial capital that must be recruited, developed, and preserved. \nOrganizational work process must take advantage of the latest tools and tech- \nniques such as business process reengineering (BPR), continuous process \nimprovement (CPI), Lean, Six Sigma, and systems thinking. The coordinated \ninfrastructure represents the envelope of operations and includes physical \nstructures, energy, leadership, operating culture, and movement of materials. \nThe ability of an organization to leverage science and technology to move up \nthe global value chain requires the softer side of project management in addi- \ntion to the technical techniques. Another key benefit of applying integrative \nproject management to oil and gas projects centers around systems safety. \nScience, technology, and engineering undertakings can be volatile and subject \nto safety violations through one of the following actions: \n\n1. Systems or individuals who deliberately, knowingly, willfully, or \nnegligently violate embedded safety requirements in science, tech- \nnology, and engineering projects \n\n2. Systems or individuals who inadvertently, accidentally, or carelessly \ncompromise safety requirements in science, technology, and engi- \nneering projects \n\nThe above potential avenues for safety violation make safety training, \neducation, practice, safety monitoring, and ethics very essential. An integra- \ntive approach to project management helps to cover all the possible ways for \nsafety compromise. \n\n\n\nProject Management Body of Knowledge \n\n\n\n51 \n\n\n\nOil and gas . \nproject management \n\n\n\nPeople \n\n\n\nRecruitment \n\nEducation \n\nTraining \n\nDevelopment \n\nRetention \n\nAdvancement \n\nWorkforce right-sizing \n\n\n\n\nInfrastructure \n\n\n\nProcess \n\n\n\nBrick and mortar \n\nEnergy \n\nOrganization structure \n\nLeadership \n\nCulture \n\nTransformation \n\nTransportation \n\nMaterials integrity \n\nSafety and security \n\nLegislation and regulation \n\nTechnology and engineerin \n\n\n\nBusiness process \n\nProcess improvement \n\nLean \n\nSix-sigma \n\nSystems thinking \n\nAsset management \n\nCapacity utilization \n\n\n\nIT \n\nData \n\nResearch \n\nDevelopment \n\nPrototyping \n\nSustainability \n\n\n\n\nFIGURE 3.1 \n\nFramework for cross-functional application of project management. \n\nProject Management Information System \n\nA project management information system (PMIS) refers to an automated \nsystem or computer software used by the project management team as a tool \nfor the execution of the activities contained in the project management plan. \n\nProject Management System \n\nA project management system (PMS) is the set of interrelated project elements \nwhose collective output, through synergy, exceeds the sum of the individual \noutputs of the elements. \n\n\n\nComposition of a Program \n\nA program is defined as a recurring group of interrelated projects managed \nin a coordinated and synergistic manner to obtain integrated results that are \n\n\n\n52 Project Management for the Oil and Gas Industry \n\n\n\n\u25a0^Organizational enterprise \n\u25a0\u25ba System of systems \n\u2022^ Systems \n\n^Programs \n\n-&gt; Projects \n\n\u25a0\u2666Work packages \n\u25a0\u00bb Tasks \n\n-\u2666Activities \n*WBS \nelements \n\n\n\nFIGURE 3.2 \n\nHierarchy of project systems. \n\n\n\nbetter than what is possible by managing the projects individually. Programs \noften include elements of collateral work outside the scope of the individual \nprojects. Thus, a program is akin to having a system of systems of projects, \nwhereby an entire enterprise might be affected. While projects have definite \nend points, programs often have unbounded life spans. Figure 3.2 shows the \nhierarchy of project systems, from organizational enterprise to work break- \ndown structure (WBS) elements. \n\n\n\nIdentification of Stakeholders \n\nStakeholders are individuals or organizations whose interests may be posi- \ntively or negatively impacted by a project. Stakeholders must be identified \nby the project team for every project. A common deficiency in this require- \nment is that organization employees are often ignored, neglected, or taken \nfor granted as stakeholders in projects going on in the organization. As the \ndefinition of stakeholders clearly suggests, if the interests of the employees \ncan be positively or negatively affected by a project, then the employees must \nbe viewed as stakeholders. All those who have a vested interest in the project \nare stakeholders and this might include the following: \n\n\u2022 Customers \n\n\u2022 Project sponsor \n\n\u2022 Users \n\n\u2022 Associated companies \n\n\u2022 Community \n\n\u2022 Project manager \n\n\u2022 Owner \n\n\u2022 Project team members \n\n\u2022 Shareholders \n\n\n\nProject Management Body of Knowledge 53 \n\n\n\nProject Management Processes \n\nThe major knowledge areas of project management are administered in a \nstructured outline covering six basic clusters as depicted in Figure 3.3. The \nimplementation clusters represent five process groups that are followed \nthroughout the project life cycle. Each cluster itself consists of several func- \ntions and operational steps. When the clusters are overlaid on the nine \nknowledge areas, we obtain a two-dimensional matrix that spans 44 major \nprocess steps. \n\nTable 3.1 shows an overlay of the project management knowledge areas \nand the implementation clusters. The monitoring and controlling clusters \nare usually administered as one lumped process group (monitoring and con- \ntrolling). In some cases, it may be helpful to separate them to highlight the \nessential attributes of each cluster of functions over the project life cycle. In \npractice, the processes and clusters do overlap. Thus, there is no crisp demar- \ncation of when and where one process ends and where another one begins \nover the project life cycle. In general, project life cycle defines the following: \n\n1. Resources that will be needed in each phase of the project life cycle \n\n2. Specific work to be accomplished in each phase of the project life \ncycle \n\nFigure 3.4 shows the major phases of project life cycle going from the con- \nceptual phase through the close-out phase. It should be noted that project \nlife cycle is distinguished from product life cycle. Project life cycle does not \nexplicitly address operational issues whereas product life cycle is mostly \nabout operational issues starting from the product's delivery to the end of \nits useful life. Note that for oil and gas projects, the shape of the life cycle \ncurve may be expedited due to the rapid developments that often occur in \ntechnology For example, for an exploration technology project, the entire \nlife cycle may be shortened, with a very rapid initial phase, even though the \n\nProject life cycle \n\n\n\n\nFIGURE 3.3 \n\nImplementation clusters for project life cycle. \n\n\n\n54 \n\n\n\nProject Management for the Oil and Gas Industry \n\n\n\nCO \n\n&lt; \n\n\n\n\u00ab \n\n\noc \n\n\nCD \n\n\nc \n\n\n9 \n\n\n3 \n\nu \n\n\nen \n\n\nOJ \n\n\n\u00ab \n\n\nX \n\n\noj \n\n\nUJ \n\n\nu \n\n\n\n\no \n\n\n\n\nh \n\n\n\n\nCu \n\n\n\n\n\n_5 \n\nU \nc \n\no \n\n\n\nc \n\n\n\nc \n\nOJ \n\n\u00a3 \n\nOJ \n\nto \na \n\nc \n\nto \n\n\n\n1 \n&gt; \n\no \n\n\n\n60 \n\n\u25a0a \n\nOJ \n\n1 \n\nO \n\nc \n\n;2 \n\n\n\n\u00a7 2 \n\n\n\n\n\no \n\n\n\n\no \n\n\nX \n\n\nu \n\n\n3 \n\n\nC \n\n\nu \n\n\n\n\nM \n\n\no \n\n\nTj \n\n\n'^H \n\n\nc \n\n\nu \n\n\n\n\n&gt; \n\n\n\n\nu \n\n\nQJ \n=3 \n\n\nhP \n\n\no \n\n\nQJ \n\n\n13 \n\n\n\nSP &amp;.

Typical characteristics of project \nlife cycle include the following: \n\n1. Cost and staffing requirements are lowest at the beginning of the \nproject and ramp up during the initial and development stages. \n\n2. The probability of successfully completing the project is lowest at the \nbeginning and highest at the end. This is because many unknowns \n(risks and uncertainties) exist at the beginning of the project. As \nthe project nears its end, there are fewer opportunities for risks and \nuncertainties. \n\n3. The risks to the project organization (project owner) are lowest at the \nbeginning and highest at the end. This is because not much invest- \nment has gone into the project at the beginning, whereas much has \nbeen committed by the end of the project. There is a higher sunk cost \nmanifested at the end of the project. \n\n4. The ability of the stakeholders to influence the final project out- \ncome (cost, quality, and schedule) is highest at the beginning and \ngets progressively lower toward the end of the project. This is \nintuitive because influence is best exerted at the beginning of an \nendeavor. \n\n5. The value of scope changes decreases over time during the project \nlife cycle while the cost of scope changes increases over time. The \nsuggestion is to decide and finalize scope as early as possible. If \nthere are to be scope changes, do them as early as possible. \n\nThe specific application context will determine the essential elements \ncontained in the life cycle of the endeavor. Life cycles of business entities, \nproducts, and projects have their own nuances that must be understood \nand managed within the prevailing organizational strategic plan. The \n\n\n\n56 Project Management for the Oil and Gas Industry \n\ncomponents of corporate, product, and project life cycles are summarized \nas follows: \n\nCorporate (business) life cycle: \n\nPlanning -&gt; Needs -&gt; Business conceptualization -&gt; \nRealization -&gt; Portfolio management \n\nProduct life cycle: \n\nFeasibility studies -^ Development -&gt; Operations -&gt; Product obsolescence \nProject life cycle: \n\nInitiation -&gt; Planning -&gt; Execution -&gt; Monitoring and control -&gt; Closeout \n\nThis book covers the knowledge areas sequentially in Chapters 2 through \n10 in the order listed above. There is no strict sequence for the application \nof the knowledge areas to a specific project. The areas represent a mixed \nbag of processes that must be followed in order to achieve a successful proj- \nect. Thus, some aspects of integration may be found under the knowledge \narea for communications. In a similar vein, a project may start with the risk \nmanagement process before proceeding into the integration process. The \nknowledge areas provide general guidelines. Each project must adapt and \ntailor the recommended techniques to the specific need and unique circum- \nstances of the project. PMBOK seeks to standardize project management \nterms and definitions by presenting a common lexicon for project manage- \nment activities. \n\nSpecific strategic, operational, and tactical goals and objectives are \nembedded within each step in the loop. For example, \"initiating\" may \nconsist of project conceptualization and description. Part of \"execut- \ning\" may include resource allocation and scheduling. \"Monitoring\" may \ninvolve project tracking, data collection, and parameter measurement. \n\"Controlling\" implies taking corrective action based on the items that are \nmonitored and evaluated. \"Closing\" involves phasing out or terminating \na project. Closing does not necessarily mean a death sentence for a project, \nas the end of one project may be used as the stepping stone to the next \nseries of endeavors. \n\nFactors of STEP Project Success or Failure \n\nThere are several factors that impinge on the success or failure of a project. \nIn oil and gas projects, factors that enhance project success include the \nfollowing: \n\n\u2022 Well-defined scope \n\n\u2022 Communication among project team members \n\n\n\nProject Management Body of Knowledge 57 \n\n\n\n\u2022 Cooperation of project teams \n\n\u2022 Coordination of project efforts \n\n\u2022 Proactive management support \n\n\u2022 Measurable metrics of project performance \n\n\u2022 Identifiable points of accountability \n\n\u2022 Realistic time, cost, and requirements \n\nWhen projects fail, it is often due to a combination of the following factors \nrelated to project requirements: \n\nRequirements are incomplete \n\nPoor definition of project objectives \n\nPoor definition of scope and premature acceptance \n\nRequirements are unrealistic \n\nRequirements are ambiguous \n\nRequirements are inconsistent \n\nChanges in requirements are unbudgeted \n\nPoor management support \n\nLack of alignment of project objectives with organizational objectives \n\nPoor communication \n\nLack of cooperation \n\nDeficient coordination of project efforts \n\n\n\nWork Breakdown Structure \n\nWBS represents the foundation over which a project is developed and \nmanaged. WBS refers to the itemization of a project for planning, schedul- \ning, and control purposes. WBS defines the scope of the project. In the proj- \nect implementation template, WBS is developed within the scope knowledge \narea under the planning cluster. The WBS diagram presents the inherent \ncomponents of a project in a structured block diagram or interrelation- \nship flow chart. WBS shows the relative hierarchies of parts (phases, seg- \nments, milestone, etc.) of the project. The purpose of constructing a WBS is \nto analyze the elemental components of the project in detail. If a project is \nproperly designed through the application of WBS at the project planning \nstage, it becomes easier to estimate cost and time requirements of the project. \nProject control is also enhanced by the ability to identify how components \nof the project link together. Tasks that are contained in the WBS collectively \n\n\n\n58 Project Management for the Oil and Gas Industry \n\n\n\ndescribe the overall project goal. Overall project planning and control can be \nimproved by using a WBS approach. A large project may be broken down \ninto smaller subprojects that may, in turn, be systematically broken down \ninto task groups. Thus, WBS permits the implementation of a \"divide-and- \nconquer\" concept for project control. \n\nIndividual components in a WBS are referred to as WBS elements, and \nthe hierarchy of each is designated by a level identifier. Elements at the \nsame level of subdivision are said to be of the same WBS level. Descending \nlevels provide increasingly detailed definition of project tasks. The com- \nplexity of a project and the degree of control desired determine the number \nof levels in the WBS. Each component is successively broken down into \nsmaller details at lower levels. The process may continue until specific \nproject activities (WBS elements) are reached. In effect, the structure of the \nWBS looks very much like an organizational chart. But it should be empha- \nsized that WBS is not an organization chart. The basic approach for prepar- \ning a WBS is as follows: \n\nLevel 1 WBS: This contains only the final goal of the project. This \nitem should be identifiable directly as an organizational budget \nitem. \n\nLevel 2 WBS: This level contains the major subsections of the project. \nThese subsections are usually identified by their contiguous location \nor by their related purposes. \n\nLevel 3 WBS: This level contains definable components of the level 2 \nsubsections. In technical terms, this may be referred to as the finite \nelement level of the project. \n\nSubsequent levels of WBS are constructed in more specific details depend- \ning on the span of control desired. If a complete WBS becomes too crowded, \nseparate WBS layouts may be drawn for the Level 2 components. A statement \nof work (SOW) or WBS summary should accompany the WBS. The SOW is \na narrative of the work to be done. It should include the objectives of the \nwork, its scope, resource requirements, tentative due date, feasibility state- \nments, and so on. A good analysis of the WBS structure will make it easier \nto perform scope monitoring, scope verification, and control project work \nlater on in the project. Figure 3.5 shows an example of a WBS structure for a \nhypothetical design project. \n\n\n\nProject Organization Structures \n\nProject organization structure provides the framework for implementing \na project across functional units of an organization.

There are three \nbasic types of organizational structures for projects: \n\n1. Functional organization structure \n\n2. Projectized organization structure \n\n3. Matrix organization structure \n\nHowever, some specialized or customized adaptations of the three basic \nstructures are used in practice to meet unique project situations. Before \nselecting an organizational structure, the project team should assess the \nnature of the job to be performed and its requirements, as contained in the \nWBS. The structure may be defined in terms of functional specializations, \ndepartmental proximity, standard management boundaries, operational \nrelationships, or product requirements. \n\n\n\nTraditional Formal Organization Structures \n\nMany organizations use the traditional formal or classical organization struc- \ntures, which show hierarchical relationships between individuals or teams \n\n\n\n60 Project Management for the Oil and Gas Industry \n\n\n\nof individuals. Traditional formal organizational structures are effective \nin service enterprises because groups with similar functional responsibili- \nties are clustered at the same level of the structure. A formal organizational \nstructure represents the officially sanctioned structure of a functional area. \nAn informal organizational structure, on the other hand, develops when \npeople organize themselves in an unofficial way to accomplish a project \nobjective. The informal organization is often very subtle in that not everyone \nin the organization is aware of its existence. Both formal and informal orga- \nnizations exist within every project. Positive characteristics of the traditional \nformal organizational structure include the following: \n\n\u2022 Availability of broad manpower base \n\n\u2022 Identifiable technical line of control \n\n\u2022 Grouping of specialists to share technical knowledge \n\n\u2022 Collective line of responsibility \n\n\u2022 Possibility of assigning personnel to several different projects \n\n\u2022 Clear hierarchy for supervision \n\n\u2022 Continuity and consistency of functional disciplines \n\n\u2022 Possibility for the establishment of departmental policies, proce- \ndures, and missions \n\nHowever, the traditional formal structure does have some shortcomings as \nsummarized below: \n\n\u2022 No one individual is directly responsible for the total project. \n\n\u2022 Project-oriented planning may be impeded. \n\n\u2022 There may not be a clear line of reporting up from the lower levels. \n\n\u2022 Coordination is complex. \n\n\u2022 A higher level of cooperation is required between adjacent levels. \n\n\u2022 The strongest functional group may wrongfully claim project authority. \n\nFunctional Organization \n\nThe most common type of formal organization is known as the functional \norganization, whereby people are organized into groups dedicated to par- \nticular functions. This structure highlights the need for specialized areas of \nresponsibilities, such as marketing, finance, accounting, engineering, produc- \ntion, design, and administration. In a functional organization, personnel are \ngrouped by job function. While organizational integration is usually desired \nin an enterprise, there still exists a need to have service differentiation. This \nhelps to distinguish between business units and functional responsibilities. \nDepending on the size and the type of auxiliary activities involved, sev- \neral minor, but supporting, functional units can be developed for a project. \n\n\n\nProject Management Body of Knowledge \n\n\n\n61 \n\n\n\nR&amp;D \n\n\n\nBasic research projects \nApplied research projects \nNew technology projects \nTechnology transfer \n\n\n\nVP \n\n\n\nCIMS projects \nCapacity planning \nMaterials analysis \nFacility layout \n\n\n\nPresident \n\n\n\nVP \n\n\n\nHealth programs \nTraining projects \nRecruiting programs \nRecreational facilities \n\n\n\nVP \n\n\n\nNew products \nAdvertising \n\n' Product support ~~ Equipment \nExpansion Acqusition \n\n\n\nVP \n\n\n\nWork measurement \nQuality assurance \n\n\n\nVP \n\n\n\nProduct design \nInstallations \nMaintenance \nEquipment \n\n\n\nFIGURE 3.6 \n\nFunctional organization structure. \n\nProjects that are organized along functional lines normally reside in a specific \ndepartment or area of specialization. The project home office or headquarters \nis located in the specific functional department. Figure 3.6 shows examples of \nprojects that are organized under the functional structure. The advantages of \na functional organization structure are presented below: \n\n\u2022 Improved accountability \n\n\u2022 Personnel within the structure have one clear chain of command \n(supervision) \n\n\u2022 Discernible lines of control \n\n\u2022 Individuals perform projects only within the boundaries of their \nrespective functions \n\n\u2022 Flexibility in manpower utilization \n\n\u2022 Enhanced comradeship of technical staff \n\n\u2022 Improved productivity of specially skilled personnel \n\n\u2022 Potential for staff advancement along functional path \n\n\u2022 Ability of the home office to serve as a refuge for project problems \n\nThe disadvantages of a functional organization structure include: \n\n\u2022 Potential division of attention between project goals and regular \nfunctions \n\n\u2022 Conflict between project objectives and regular functions \n\n\n\n62 \n\n\n\nProject Management for the Oil and Gas Industry \n\n\n\n\u2022 Poor coordination similar project responsibilities \n\n\u2022 Unreceptive attitudes on the part of the surrogate department \n\n\u2022 Multiple layers of management \n\n\u2022 Lack of concentrated effort \n\nProjectized Organization \n\nAnother approach to organizing a project is to use the end product or goal of \nthe project as the determining factor for personnel structure. This is known \nas the projectized structured, but often referred to as pure project organi- \nzation or product organization, whereby the project is organized around a \nparticular product (e.g., project deliverable, goal). The project is set up as a \nunique entity within the parent organization. It has its own dedicated tech- \nnical staff and administration. It is linked to the rest of the system through \nprogress reports, organizational policies, procedures, and funding. The inter- \nface between product-organized projects and other elements of the organiza- \ntion may be strict or liberal, depending on the organization. An example of \na pure project organization is shown in Figure 3.7. Projects A, B, C, and D in \nthe figure may directly represent product types A, B, C, and D. Projectized \norganization structure is suitable for two categories of companies: \n\n1. Companies that use management-by-projects as a philosophy of \ntheir operations \n\n2. Companies that derive most of their revenues from performing proj- \nects for a fee \n\nSuch organizations normally have performance systems in place to \nmonitor, track, and control projects. For these companies, the personnel are \noften colocated. \n\n\n\nProject A \nmanager \n\n\n\nDesign \n\n\n\nManuf. \n\n\n\nProgram manager \n\n\n\nProject B \nmanager \n\n\n\nDesign \n\n\n\nManuf. \n\n\n\nProject C \nmanager \n\n\n\nProject D \nmanager \n\n\n\nDesign \n\n\n\nManuf. \n\n\n\nDesign \n\n\n\nManuf. \n\n\n\nFIGURE 3.7 \n\nProjectized organization structure. \n\n\n\nProject Management Body of Knowledge 63 \n\n\n\nThe project organization is common in industries that have multiple \nproduct lines. Unlike the functional, the project organization decentralizes \nfunctions. It creates a unit consisting of specialized skills around a given \nproject or product. Sometimes referred to as a team, task force, or product \ngroup, the project organization is common in public, research, and manufac- \nturing organizations where specially organized and designated groups are \nassigned specific functions. A major advantage of the product organization \nis that it gives the project members a feeling of dedication to and identifica- \ntion with a particular goal. \n\nA possible shortcoming of the project organization is the requirement that \nthe product group be sufficiently funded to be able to stand alone. The prod- \nuct group may be viewed as an ad hoc unit that is formed for the purpose \nof a specific product. The personnel involved in the project are dedicated to \nthe particular mission at hand. At the conclusion of the mission (e.g., prod- \nuct phase-out), the personnel may be reassigned to other projects. Product \norganization can facilitate the most diverse and flexible grouping of project \nparticipants. It has the following advantages: \n\nSimplicity of structure \n\nUnity of project purpose \n\nLocalization of project failures \n\nCondensed and focused communication lines \n\nFull authority of the project manager \n\nQuicker decisions due to centralized authority \n\nSkill development due to project specialization \n\nImproved motivation, commitment, and concentration \n\nFlexibility in determining time, cost, performance trade-offs \n\nProject team's reporting directly to one project manager or boss \n\nAbility of individuals to acquire and maintain expertise on a given \nproject \n\nThe disadvantages of product organization are: \n\n\u2022 Narrow view on the part of project personnel (as opposed to a global \norganizational view) \n\n\u2022 The same functional expertise is replicated (or duplicated) in mul- \ntiple projects \n\n\u2022 Mutually exclusive allocation of resources (one worker to one project) \n\n\u2022 Duplication of efforts on different but similar projects \n\n\u2022 Monopoly of organizational resources \n\n\u2022 Project team members may have concerns about life-after-the-project \n\n\u2022 Reduced skill diversification \n\n\n\n64 \n\n\n\nProject Management for the Oil and Gas Industry \n\n\n\nAnother disadvantage of the product organization is the difficulty \nsupervisors have in assessing the technical competence of individual team \nmembers. Since managers may supervise functional personnel in fields for- \neign to them, it is difficult for them to assess technical capability. For exam- \nple, a project manager in a projectized structure may supervise personnel \nfrom accounting, engineering, design, manufacturing, sales, marketing, and \nso on. Many major organizations face this problem. \n\n\n\nMatrix Organization Structure \n\nThe matrix organization structure is a blend of functional and projectized \nstructures. It is a frequently used organization structure in business and \nindustry. It is used where there is multiple managerial accountability and \nresponsibility for a project. It combines the advantages of the traditional \nstructure and the product organization structure. The hybrid configuration of \nthe matrix structure facilitates maximum resource utilization and increased \nperformance within time, cost, and performance constraints. There are usu- \nally two chains of command involving both horizontal and vertical report- \ning lines. The horizontal line deals with the functional line of responsibility \nwhile the vertical line deals with the project line of responsibility. An exam- \nple of a matrix structure is shown in Figure 3.8. The personnel along each \nvertical line of reporting cross over horizontally to work on the \"matrixed\" \nproject. The matrix structure is said to be strong if it is more closely aligned \n\n\n\n\n\nChief \nexecutive officer \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDirector of \nprojects \n\n\n\n\nFinance \ndepartment \n\n\n\n\nManufacturing \ndepartment \n\n\n\n\nEngineering \ndepartment \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25ba t \n\n\n\n\nI \n\n\n1 \n'roject responsibilit \n\n\nV \n\n\n\n\n\n\nProject A \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\na \n\n\n\n\nVertical/horizontal \ncoordination \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3 \n\no \n\n\n\n\nProject B \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProject C \n\n\n\n\nC \n=1 \n\n\n\n\nIU \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFIGURE 3.8 \n\nMatrix organization structure. \n\n\n\nProject Management Body of Knowledge 65 \n\n\n\nwith the projectized organization structure, and it is said to be a weak matrix \nstructure if it is more closely aligned to a functional structure. A balanced \nmatrix structure blends projectized and functional structures equally. \nAdvantages of matrix organization include the following: \n\nGood team interaction \n\nConsolidation of objectives \n\nMultilateral flow of information \n\nLateral mobility for job advancement \n\nIndividuals have an opportunity to work on a variety of projects \n\nEfficient sharing and utilization of resources \n\nReduced project cost due to sharing of personnel \n\nContinuity of functions after project completion \n\nStimulating interactions with other functional teams \n\nFunctional lines rally to support the project efforts \n\nEach person has a \"home\" office after project completion \n\nCompany knowledge base is equally available to all projects \n\nSome of the disadvantages of matrix organization are summarized below: \n\n\u2022 Matrix response time may be slow for fast-paced projects \n\n\u2022 Each project organization operates independently \n\n\u2022 Overhead cost due to additional lines of command \n\n\u2022 Potential conflict of project priorities \n\n\u2022 Problems inherent in having multiple bosses \n\n\u2022 Complexity of the structure \n\nTraditionally industrial projects are conducted in serial functional imple- \nmentations such as R&amp;D, engineering, manufacturing, and marketing. At \neach stage, unique specifications and work patterns may be used without \nconsulting the preceding and succeeding phases. The consequence is that \nthe end product may not possess the original intended characteristics. For \nexample, the first project in the series might involve the production of one \ncomponent while the subsequent projects might involve the production of \nother components. The composite product may not achieve the desired per- \nformance because the components were not designed and produced from \na unified point of view. The major appeal of matrix organization is that it \nattempts to provide synergy within groups in an organization.

It contains the \noutline of the series actions needed to accomplish the project goal. Project \nplanning determines how to initiate a project and execute its objectives. It \nmay be a simple statement of a project goal or it may be a detailed account of \nprocedures to be followed during the project life cycle. In a project plan, all \nroles and responsibilities must be clearly defined. A project plan is not a bar \nchart or Gantt chart. The project manager must be versatile enough to have \nknowledge of most of the components of a project plan. The usual compo- \nnents of a detailed project plan include the following: \n\n\u2022 Scope planning \n\n\u2022 Scope definition \n\n\u2022 WBS \n\n\u2022 Activity definition \n\n\u2022 Activity sequencing \n\n\u2022 Activity resource estimating \n\n\u2022 Activity duration estimating \n\n\u2022 Schedule development \n\n\u2022 Cost estimating \n\n\u2022 Cost budgeting \n\n\n\nProject Management Body of Knowledge 67 \n\n\n\nQuality plan \n\nHuman resource plan \n\nCommunications plan \n\nRisk management plan \n\nRisk identification \n\nQualitative and quantitative risk analysis \n\nRisk response planning \n\nContingencies \n\nPurchase plan \n\nAcquisition plan \n\nContracting plan \n\n\n\nIntegrated Systems Approach to STEP Projects \n\nProject management tools for STEP projects can be classified into three major \ncategories described below: \n\n1. Qualitative tools: These are the managerial tools that aid in the \ninterpersonal and organizational processes required for project \nmanagement. \n\n2. Quantitative tools: These are analytical techniques that aid in the \ncomputational aspects of project management. \n\n3. Computer tools: These are computer software and hardware tools \nthat simplify the process of planning, organizing, scheduling, and \ncontrolling a project. Software tools can help in with both the qual- \nitative and quantitative analyses needed for project management. \n\n\n\nManaging Project Requirements \n\nIt is often said that Henry Ford offered his Model T automobile customers \nonly one color option by saying that customers could have \"any color they \nwant, as long as it is black.\" But the fact is that Ford initially offered three \ncolors: green, bright red, and green from 1908 through 1914. But when his \nproduction technology advanced to the stage of mass production on mov- \ning assembly line, the new process required a fast-drying paint, and only \none particular black paint pigment met the requirements. Thus, as a result \nof the emergence of fast-moving mass production lines, Ford was forced to \nlimit color options to black only. This led to the need for the famous quote. \nThe black-only era spanned the period from 1914 through 1925, when fur- \nther painting advances made it possible to have more color options. This \nrepresents a classic example of how technology limitations might dictate the \n\n\n\nProject Management for the Oil and Gas Industry \n\n\n\n\nProject plan \n\nDefine goals and objectives \n\nWrite mission statement \n\nWrite statement of work \n\n\n\nManagement \n\napproaches \n\nProject organization \n\nAnalytical tools \n\nCPM, PERT \nSystems model \n\n\n\nXZ \n\n\n\nOptimization models \n\nModel development \n\n-l\\^ Solution technique \n\nOutput interpretation \n\nCost optimization \n\nSchedule \n\nOptimization \n\n\n\nI \n\n\n\nComputer applications \n\nSoftware selection \n\nData organization \n\nSimulation \n\nSchedule generation \n\nTracking and reporting \n\n\n\nMerge results \n\n\n\n^Z \n\n\n\nRevise plan, modify model, update software run \n\n\n\n\nFIGURE 3.9 \n\nFlowchart of integrated STEP project management. \n\nexecution of project requirements. In oil and gas project management, an \norganization must remain flexible with operational choices as reflected in \nthe flowchart in Figure 3.9. \n\n\n\nProject Integration \n\n\n\nProject integration management specifies how the various parts of a project \ncome together to make up the complete project. This knowledge area recog- \nnizes the importance of linking several aspects of a project into an integrated \nwhole. This section emphasizes the importance of \"togetherness\" in any project \n\n\n\nProject Management Body of Knowledge 69 \n\n\n\nenvironment. Project integration management area includes the processes and \nactivities needed to identify, define, combine, unify, and coordinate the various \nprocesses and project activities. The traditional concepts of systems analysis \nare applicable to project processes. The definition of a project system and its \ncomponents refers to the collection of interrelated elements organized for the \npurpose of achieving a common goal. The elements are organized to work syn- \nergistically together to generate a unified output that is greater than the sum of \nthe individual outputs of the components. The harmony of project integration \nis evident in the characteristic symbol that this book uses to denote this area of \nproject management knowledge. \n\nWhile the knowledge areas of project management, as discussed in \nthe preceding sections, overlap and can be implemented in alternate \norders, it is still apparent that project integration management is the first \nstep of the project effort. This is particularly based on the fact that the proj- \nect charter and the project scope statement are developed under the project \nintegration process. In order to achieve a complete and unified execution \nof a project, both qualitative and quantitative skills must come into play \n\n\n\nStepwise Project Integration \n\nThe integration component of the body of knowledge consists of the ele- \nments shown below: \n\nStep 1: Develop project charter \nStep 2: Develop preliminary project scope \nStep 3: Develop project management plan \nStep 4: Direct and manage project execution \nStep 5: Monitor and control project work \nStep 6: Perform integrated change control \nStep 7: Close project \n\nThe seven elements in the block diagram are carried out across the process \ngroups presented earlier. The overlay of the elements and the process groups \nare shown in Table 3.3. \n\nIn addition to the standard PMBOK inputs, tools, techniques, and outputs, \nthe project team will add in-house items of interest to the steps presented in \nthis section. Such in-house items are summarized below: \n\n\u2022 Inputs: Other in-house (custom) factors of relevance and interest \n\n\u2022 Tools and techniques: Other in-house (custom) tools and techniques \n\n\u2022 Outputs: Other in-house outputs, reports, and data inferences of \ninterest to the organization \n\n\n\n70 \n\n\n\nProject Management for the Oil and Gas Industry \n\n\n\nTABLE 3.3 \n\nImplementation of Project Integration Elements across Process Groups \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMonitoring and \n\n\n\n\nInitiating \n\n\nPlanning \n\n\nExecuting Controlling \n\n\nClosing \n\n\nProject 1.

It is a document that provides \nauthority to the project manager and it is usually issued by a project initia- \ntor or sponsor external to the project organization. The purpose of a charter \nis to define at a high level what the project is about, what the project will \ndeliver, what resources are needed, what resources are available, and how \nthe project is justified. The charter also represents an organizational commit- \nment to dedicate the time and resources to the project. The charter should be \nshared with all stakeholders as a part of the communication requirement for \nthe project. Cooperating stakeholders will not only sign-off on the project, \n\nTABLE 3.4 \n\nTools and Techniques for Developing Project Charter within \nIntegration Management \n\nStep 1: Develop Project

Projects are usually \nchartered by an enterprise, a government agency, a company, a program \norganization, or a portfolio organization in response to one or more of the \nfollowing business opportunities or organizational problems: \n\n\u2022 Market demand \n\n\u2022 Response to regulatory development \n\n\u2022 Customer request \n\n\u2022 Business need \n\n\n\nProject Management Body of Knowledge \n\n\n\n73 \n\n\n\nTABLE 3.10 \n\nTools and Techniques for Closing Project within Integration Management \n\n\n\nInputs \n\n\n\nStep 7: Close Project \nTools and Techniques \n\n\n\nOutput(s) \n\n\n\nProject management plan \nContract documentation \nEnterprise environmental factors \nOrganizational process assets \nWork performance information \nDeliverables \n\nOther in-house (custom) factors \nof relevance and interest \n\n\n\nProject management \n\nmethodology \nProject management \n\ninformation system \nExpert judgment \nOther in-house (custom) \n\ntools and techniques \n\n\n\nAdministrative closure \n\nprocedure \nContract closure procedure \nFinal product, service or result \nUpdates on organizational \n\nprocess assets \nOther in-house outputs, \n\nreports, and data inferences \n\nof interest to the organization \n\n\n\n\u2022 Exploitation of technological advance \n\n\u2022 Legal requirement \n\n\u2022 Social need \n\nThe driving force for a project charter is the need for an organization \nto make a decision about which projects to authorize to respond to oper- \national threats or opportunities. It is desired for a charter to be brief. \nDepending on the size and complexity of a project, the charter should not \nbe more than two to three pages. Where additional details are warranted, \nthe expatiating details can be provided as addenda to the basic charter \ndocument. The longer the basic charter, the less the likelihood that every- \none will read and imbibe the contents. So, brevity and conciseness are \ndesired virtues of good project charters. The charter should succinctly \nestablish the purpose of the project, the participants, and general vision \nfor the project. \n\nThe project charter is used as the basis for developing project plans. While \nit is developed at the outset of a project, a charter should always be fluid. \nIt should be reviewed and updated throughout the life of the project. The \ncomponents of the project charter are summarized below: \n\n\u2022 Project overview \n\n\u2022 Assigned project manager and authority level \n\n\u2022 Project requirements \n\n\u2022 Business needs \n\n\u2022 Project purpose, justification, and goals \n\n\u2022 Impact statement \n\n\u2022 Constraints (time, cost, performance) \n\n\u2022 Assumptions \n\n\n\n74 Project Management for the Oil and Gas Industry \n\n\n\n\u2022 Project scope \n\n\u2022 Financial implications \n\n\u2022 Project approach (policies, procedures) \n\n\u2022 Project organization \n\n\u2022 Participating organizations and their respective roles and level of \nparticipation \n\n\u2022 Summary milestone schedule \n\n\u2022 Stakeholder influences \n\n\u2022 Assumptions and constraints (organizational, environmental, \nexternal) \n\n\u2022 Business plan and expected return on investment (ROI), if applicable \n\n\u2022 Summary budget \n\nThe project charter does not include the project plan. Planning documents, \nwhich may include project schedule, quality plan, staff plan, communication \nhierarchy, financial plan, and risk plan, should be prepared and dissemi- \nnated separately from the charter. \n\n\u2022 Project overview \n\n\u2022 The project overview provides a brief summary of the entire \nproject charter. It may provide a brief history of the events that \nled to the project, an explanation of why the project was initi- \nated, a description of project intent and the identity of the origi- \nnal project owner. \n\n\u2022 Project goals \n\n\u2022 Project goals identify the most significant reasons for perform- \ning a project. Goals should describe improvements the project is \nexpected to accomplish along with who will benefit from these \nimprovements. This section should explain what various bene- \nfactors will be able to accomplish due to the project. Note that \nTriple C approach requires these details as a required step to \nsecuring cooperation. \n\n\u2022 Impact statement \n\n\u2022 The impact statement identifies the influence the project may \nhave on the business, operations, schedule, other projects, cur- \nrent technology, and existing applications. While these topics are \nbeyond the domain of this project, each of these items should be \nraised for possible action. \n\n\u2022 Constraints and assumptions \n\n\u2022 Constraints and assumptions identify any deliberate or implied \nlimitations or restrictions placed on the project along with any \n\n\n\nProject Management Body of Knowledge 75 \n\n\n\ncurrent or future environment the project must accommodate. \nThese factors will influence many project decisions and strate- \ngies. The potential impact of each constraint or assumptions \nshould be identified. \n\nProject scope \n\n\u2022 Project scope defines the operational boundaries for the proj- \nect. Specific scope components are the areas or functions to be \nimpacted by the project and the work that will be performed. \nThe project scope should identify both what is within the scope \nof the project and what is outside the scope of the project. \n\nProject objectives \n\n\u2022 Project objectives identify expected deliverables from the project \nand the criteria that must be satisfied before the project is con- \nsidered complete. \n\nFinancial summary \n\n\u2022 The financial summary provides a recap of expected costs and \nbenefits due to the project. These factors should be more fully \ndefined in the cost-benefit analysis of the project. Project finan- \ncials must be reforecast during the life of the effort. \n\nProject approach \n\n\u2022 Project approach identifies the general strategy for completing \nthe project and explains any methods or processes, particularly \npolicies and procedures that will be used during the project. \n\nProject organization \n\n\u2022 The project organization identifies the roles and responsibili- \nties needed to create a meaningful and responsive structure that \nenables the project to be successful. Project organization must \nidentify the people who will play each assigned role. At mini- \nmum, this section should identify who plays the roles of project \nowner, project manager, and core project team. \n\n\u2022 A project owner is required for each project. \n\n- This role must be filled by one or more individuals who are \nthe fiscal trustee(s) for the project to the larger organiza- \ntion. This person considers the global impact of the project \nand deems it worthy of the required expenditure of money \nand time. The project owner communicates the vision for \nthe effort and certifies the initial project charter and project \nplan. Should changes be required, the project owner con- \nfirms these changes and any influence on the project charter \nand project plan. When project decisions cannot be made at \nthe team level, the project owner must resolve these issues. \nThe project owner must play an active role throughout the \n\n\n\n76 Project Management for the Oil and Gas Industry \n\n\n\nproject, especially ensuring that needed resources have been \ncommitted to the project and remain available. \n\n\u2022 A project manager is required for each project. \n\n- The project manager is responsible for initiating, planning, \nexecuting, and controlling the total project effort. Members \nof the project team report to the project manager for project \nassignments and are accountable to the project manager for \nthe completion of their assigned work. \n\nDefinition of Inputs to Step 1: \n\nContract: A contract is a contractual agreement between the organiza- \ntion performing the project and the organizing requesting the proj- \nect. It is treated as an input if the project is being done for an external \ncustomer. \n\nProject statement of work (SOW): This is a narrative description of prod- \nucts or services to be supplied by the project. For internal projects, \nit is provided by the project initiator or sponsor. For external proj- \nects, it is provided by the customer as part of the bid document. For \nexample, request for proposal, request for information, request for \nbid, or contract statements may contain specific work to be done. The \nSOW indicates the following: \n\n\u2022 Business need based on required training, market demand, tech- \nnological advancement, legal requirement, government regula- \ntions, industry standards, or trade consensus \n\n\u2022 Product scope description, which documents project require- \nments and characteristics of the product or service that the proj- \nect will deliver \n\n\u2022 Strategic plan, which ensures that the project supports organiza- \ntion's strategic goals and business tactical actions \n\nEnterprise environmental factors: These are factors that impinge upon the \nbusiness environment of the organization. They include organiza- \ntional structure, business culture, governmental standards, industry \nrequirements, quality standards, trade agreements, physical infra- \nstructure, technical assets, proprietary information, existing human \nresources, personnel administration, internal work authorization \nsystem, marketplace profile, competition, stakeholder requirements, \nstakeholder risk tolerance levels, commercial obligations, access to \nstandardized cost estimating data, industry risk, technology vari- \nances, product life cycle, and PMIS. \n\nOrganizational process assets: These refer to the business processes \nused within an organization. They include standard processes, \nguidelines, policies, procedures, operational templates, criteria for \n\n\n\nProject Management Body of Knowledge 11 \n\n\n\ncustomizing standards to specific project requirements, organiza- \ntion communication matrix, responsibility matrix, project closure \nguidelines (e.g., sunset clause), financial controls procedure, defect \nmanagement procedures, change control procedures, risk control \nprocedures, process for issuing work authorizations, processes for \napproving work authorizations, management of corporate knowl- \nedge base, and so on. \n\nDefinition of Tools and Techniques for Step 1: \n\nProject selection methods: These methods are used to determine which \nprojects an organization will select for implementation. The meth- \nods can range from basic seat-of-the-pants heuristics to highly com- \nplex analytical techniques. Some examples are benefit measurement \nmethods, comparative measure of worth analysis, scoring models, \nbenefit contribution, capital rationing approaches, budget allocation \nmethods, and graphical analysis tools. Analytical techniques are \nmathematical models that use linear programming, nonlinear pro- \ngramming, dynamic programming, integer programming, multiat- \ntribute optimization, and other algorithmic tools. \n\nProject management methodology: This defines the set of project manage- \nment process groups, their collateral processes, and related control \nfunctions that are combined for implementation for a particular \nproject. The methodology may or may not follow a project man- \nagement standard. It may be an adaptation of an existing project \nimplementation template. It can also be a formal mature process \nor informal technique that aids in effectively developing a project \ncharter. \n\nPMIS: This is a standardized set of automated tools available within the \norganization and integrated into a system for the purpose of sup- \nporting the generation of a project charter, facilitating feedback as \nthe charter is refined, controlling changes to the project charter, or \nreleasing the approved document. \n\nExpert judgment: This is often used to assess the inputs needed to develop \nthe project charter. Expert judgment is available from sources such \nas experiential database of the organization, knowledge repository, \nknowledge management practices, knowledge transfer protocol, \nbusiness units within the organization, consultants, stakeholders, \ncustomers, sponsors, professional organizations, technical associa- \ntions, and industry groups. \n\nDefinition of Output of Step 1: \n\nProject charter: As defined earlier in this chapter, project charter is a \nformal document that authorizes a project. It provides authority to the \n\n\n\n78 Project Management for the Oil and Gas Industry \n\n\n\nproject manager and it is usually issued by a project initiator or spon- \nsor external to the project organization. It empowers the project team \nto carry out actions needed to accomplish the end goal of the project. \n\nStep 2: Develop Preliminary Project Scope Statement \n\nProject scope presents a definition of what needs to be done. It specifies the \ncharacteristics and boundaries of the project and its associated products \nand services, as well as the methods of acceptance and scope control. Scope \nis developed based on information provided by the projected initiator or \nsponsor. Scope statement includes the following: \n\nProject and product objectives \n\nProduct characteristics \n\nService requirements \n\nProduct acceptance criteria \n\nProject constraints \n\nProject assumptions \n\nInitial project organization \n\nInitial defined risks \n\nSchedule milestones \n\nInitial WBS \n\nOrder-of-magnitude cost estimate \n\nProject configuration management requirements \n\nApproval requirements \n\nDefinition of Inputs to Step 2: \n\nInputs for Step 2 are the same as defined for Step 1 covering project charter, \nSOW, environmental factors, and organizational process assets. \n\nDefinition of Tools and Techniques for Step 2: \n\nThe tools and techniques for Step 2 are the same as defined for Step 1 and \ncover project management methodology, PMIS, and expert judgment. \n\nDefinition of Output of Step 2: \n\nThe output of Step 2 is the preliminary project scope statement, which was \ndefined and described earlier. \n\nStep 3: Develop Project Management Plan \n\nA project management plan includes all actions necessary to define, integrate, \nand coordinate all subsidiary and complementing plans into a cohesive proj- \nect management plan. It defines how the project is executed, monitored and \n\n\n\nProject Management Body of Knowledge 79 \n\n\n\ncontrolled, and closed. The project management plan is updated and revised \nthrough the integrated change control process. In addition, the process of \ndeveloping project management plan documents the collection of outputs of \nplanning processes and includes the following: \n\n\u2022 Project management processes selected by the project management \nteam \n\n\u2022 Level of implementation of each selected process \n\n\u2022 Descriptions of tools and techniques to be used for accomplishing \nthose processes \n\n\u2022 How selected processes will be used to manage the specific project \n\n\u2022 How work will be executed to accomplish the project objectives \n\n\u2022 How changes will be monitored and controlled \n\n\u2022 How configuration management will be performed \n\n\u2022 How integrity of the performance measurement baselines will be \nmaintained and used \n\n\u2022 The requirements and techniques for communication among \nstakeholders \n\n\u2022 The selected project life cycle and, for multiphase projects, the asso- \nciated project phases \n\n\u2022 Key management reviews for content, extent, and timing \n\nThe project management plan can be a summary or integration of relevant \nsubsidiary, auxiliary, and ancillary project plans. All efforts that are expected \nto contribute to the project goal can be linked into the overall project plan, \neach with the appropriate level of detail. Examples of subsidiary plans are \nthe following: \n\nProject scope management plan \nSchedule management plan \nCost management plan \nQuality management plan \nProcess improvement plan \nStaffing management plan \nCommunication management plan \nRisk management plan \nProcurement management plan \nMilestone list \nResource calendar \nCost baseline \n\n\n\n80 Project Management for the Oil and Gas Industry \n\n\n\n\u2022 Quality baseline \n\n\u2022 Risk register \n\nDefinition of Inputs to Step 3: \n\nInputs to Step 3 are the same as defined previously and include preliminary \nproject scope statement, project management processes, enterprise environ- \nmental factors, and organizational process assets. \n\nDefinition of Tools and Techniques for Step 3: \n\nThe tools and techniques for Step 3 are project management methodology, \nproject information system, and expert judgment. Project management \nmethodology defines a process that aids a project management team in \ndeveloping and controlling changes to the project plan. PMIS at this step \ncovers the following segments: \n\n\u2022 Automated system, which is used by the project team to do the \nfollowing: \n\n\u2022 Support generation of the project management plan \n\n\u2022 Facilitate feedback as the document is developed \n\n\u2022 Control changes to the project management plan \n\n\u2022 Release the approved document \n\n\u2022 Configuration management system, which is a subsystem that \nincludes subprocesses for accomplishing the following: \n\n\u2022 Submitting proposed changes \n\n\u2022 Tracking systems for reviewing and authorizing changes \n\n\u2022 Providing a method to validate approved changes \n\n\u2022 Implementing change management system \n\n\u2022 Configuration management system, which forms a collection of for- \nmal procedures used to apply technical and administrative over- \nsight to do the following: \n\n\u2022 Identify and document functional and physical characteristics of \na product or component \n\n\u2022 Control any changes to such characteristics \n\n\u2022 Record and report each change and its implementation status \n\n\u2022 Support audit of the products or components to verify confor- \nmance to requirements \n\n\u2022 Change control system is the segment of PMIS that provides a collec- \ntion of formal procedures that define how project deliverables and \ndocumentation are controlled. \n\nExpert judgment, the third tool for Step 3, is applied to develop technical \nand management details to be included in the project management plan. \n\n\n\nProject Management Body of Knowledge 81 \n\n\n\nDefinition of Output of Step 3: \n\nThe output of Step 3 is the project management plan. \n\nStep 4: Direct and Manage Project Execution \n\nStep 4 requires the project manager and project team to perform multiple \nactions to execute the project plan successfully. Some of the required activi- \nties for project execution are summarized below: \n\nPerform activities to accomplish project objectives \n\nExpend effort and spend funds \n\nStaff, train, and manage project team members \n\nObtain quotation, bids, offers, or proposals as appropriate \n\nImplement planned methods and standards \n\nCreate, control, verify, and validate project deliverables \n\nManage risks and implement risk response activities \n\nManage sellers \n\nAdapt approved changes into scope, plans, and environment \n\nEstablish and manage external and internal communication channels \n\nCollect project data and report cost, schedule, technical and quality \nprogress and status information to facilitate forecasting \n\n\u2022 Collect and document lessons learned and implement approved \nprocess improvement activities \n\nThe process of directing and managing project execution also requires \nimplementation of the following: \n\n\u2022 Approved corrective actions that will bring anticipated project per- \nformance into compliance with the plan \n\n\u2022 Approved preventive actions to reduce the probability of potential \nnegative consequences \n\n\u2022 Approved defect repair requests to correct product defects during \nquality process \n\nDefinition of Inputs to Step 4: \n\nInputs to Step 4 are summarized as follows: \n\n\u2022 Project management plan. \n\n\u2022 Approved corrective actions: These are documented, authorized direc- \ntions required to bring expected future project performance into \nconformance with the project management plan. \n\n\n\n82 Project Management for the Oil and Gas Industry \n\n\n\n\u2022 Approved change requests: These include documented, authorized \nchanges to expand or contract project scope. Can also modify poli- \ncies, project management plans, procedures, costs, budgets, or revise \nschedules. Change requests are implemented by the project team. \n\n\u2022 Approved defect repair: This is documented, authorized request for \nproduct correction of defect found during the quality inspection or \nthe audit process. \n\n\u2022 Validated defect repair: This is notification that reinspected repaired \nitems have either been accepted or rejected. \n\n\u2022 Administrative closure procedure: This documents all the activities, \ninteractions, and related roles and responsibilities needed in execut- \ning the administrative closure procedure for the project. \n\nDefinition of Tools and Techniques for Step 4: \n\nThe tools and techniques for Step 4 are project management methodology \nand PMIS, and they were previously defined. \n\nDefinition of Outputs of Step 4: \n\n\u2022 Deliverables \n\n\u2022 Requested changes \n\n\u2022 Implemented change requests \n\n\u2022 Implemented corrective actions \n\n\u2022 Implemented preventive actions \n\n\u2022 Implemented defect repair \n\n\u2022 Work performance information \n\nStep 5: Monitor and Control Project Work \n\nNo organization can be strategic without being quantitative. It is through \nquantitative measures that a project can be tracked, measured, assessed, and \ncontrolled. The need for monitoring and control can be evident in the request \nfor quantification (RFQ) that some project funding agencies use. Some quan- \ntifiable performance measures are schedule outcome, cost effectiveness, \nresponse time, number of reworks, and lines of computer codes developed. \nMonitoring and controlling are performed to monitor project processes asso- \nciated with initiating, planning, executing, and closing and is concerned \nwith the following: \n\n\u2022 Comparing actual performance against plan \n\n\u2022 Assessing performance to determine whether corrective or preven- \ntive actions are required, and then recommending those actions as \nnecessary \n\n\n\nProject Management Body of Knowledge 83 \n\n\n\n\u2022 Analyzing, tracking, and monitoring project risks to make sure \nrisks are identified, status is reported, and response plans are being \nexecuted \n\n\u2022 Maintaining an accurate timely information base concerning the \nproject's products and associated documentation \n\n\u2022 Providing information to support status reporting, progress mea- \nsurement, and forecasting \n\n\u2022 Providing forecasts to update current cost and schedule information \n\n\u2022 Monitoring implementation of approved changes \n\nDefinition of Inputs to Step 5: \n\nInputs to Step 5 include the following: \n\n\u2022 Project management plan \n\n\u2022 Work performance plan \n\n\u2022 Rejected change requests \n\n\u2022 Change requests \n\n\u2022 Supporting documentation \n\n\u2022 Change review status showing disposition of rejected change \nrequests \n\nDefinition of Tools and Techniques for Step 5: \n\n\u2022 Project management methodology. \n\n\u2022 PMIS. \n\n\u2022 Earned value technique: This measures performance as project \nmoves from initiation through closure. It provides means to forecast \nfuture performance based on past performance. \n\n\u2022 Expert judgment. \n\nDefinition of Outputs of Step 5: \n\n\u2022 Recommended corrective actions: Documented recommendations \nrequired to bring expected future project performance into confor- \nmance with the project management plan \n\n\u2022 Recommended preventive actions: Documented recommendations that \nreduce the probability of negative consequences associated with \nproject risks \n\n\u2022 Forecasts: Estimates or predictions of conditions and events in the \nproject's future based on information available at the time of the \nforecast \n\n\n\n84 Project Management for the Oil and Gas Industry \n\n\n\n\u2022 Recommended defect repair: Some defects found during quality inspec- \ntion and audit process recommended for correction \n\n\u2022 Requested changes \n\nStep 6: Integrated Change Control \n\nIntegrated change control is performed from project inception through com- \npletion. It is required because projects rarely run according to plan. Major \ncomponents of integrated change control include the following: \n\n\u2022 Identifying when a change needs to occur or when a change has \noccurred \n\n\u2022 Amending factors that circumvent change control procedures \n\n\u2022 Reviewing and approving requested changes \n\n\u2022 Managing and regulating flow of approved changes \n\n\u2022 Maintaining and approving recommended corrective and preven- \ntive actions \n\n\u2022 Controlling and updating scope, cost, budget, schedule, and quality \nrequirements based upon approved changes \n\n\u2022 Documenting the complete impact of requested changes \n\n\u2022 Validating defect repair \n\n\u2022 Controlling project quality to standards based on quality reports \n\nCombining configuration management system with integrated change \ncontrol includes identifying, documenting, and controlling changes to the \nbaseline. Project-wide application of the configuration management system, \nincluding change control processes, accomplishes three major objectives: \n\n\u2022 Establishes evolutionary method to consistently identify and request \nchanges to established baselines and to assess the value and effec- \ntiveness of those changes \n\n\u2022 Provides opportunities to continuously validate and improve the \nproject by considering the impact of each change \n\n\u2022 Provides the mechanism for the project management team to consis- \ntently communicate all changes to the stakeholders \n\nIntegrated change control process includes some specific activities of the \nconfiguration management as summarized below: \n\n\u2022 Configuration identification: This provides the basis from which the \nconfiguration of products is defined and verified, products and \ndocuments are labeled, changes are managed, and accountability is \nmaintained. \n\n\n\nProject Management Body of Knowledge 85 \n\n\n\n\u2022 Configuration status accounting: This involves capturing, storing, and \naccessing configuration information needed to manage products \nand product information effectively. \n\n\u2022 Configuration verification and auditing: This involves confirming that \nperformance and functional requirements defined in the configura- \ntion documentation have been satisfied. \n\nUnder integrated change control, every documented requested change \nmust be either accepted or rejected by some authority within the project \nmanagement team or an external organization representing the initiator, \nsponsor, or customer. Integrated change control can, possibly, be controlled \nby a change control board. \n\nDefinition of Inputs to Step 6: \n\nThe inputs to Step 6 include the following items, which were all described \nearlier: \n\n\u2022 Project management plan \n\n\u2022 Requested changes \n\n\u2022 Work performance information \n\n\u2022 Recommended preventive actions \n\n\u2022 Deliverables \n\nDefinition of Tools and Techniques for Step 6: \n\n\u2022 Project management methodology: This defines a process that helps a \nproject management team in implementing integrated change con- \ntrol for the project. \n\n\u2022 PMIS: This is an automated system used by the team as an aid for the \nimplementation of an integrated change control process for the proj- \nect. It also facilitates feedback for the project and controls changes \nacross the project. \n\n\u2022 Expert judgment: This refers to the process whereby the project team \nuses stakeholders with expert judgment on the change control board \nto control and approve all requested changes to any aspect of the \nproject. \n\nDefinition of Outputs of Step 6: \n\nThe outputs of Step 6 include the following: \n\n\u2022 Approved change requested \n\n\u2022 Rejected change requests \n\n\u2022 Project management plan (updates) \n\n\u2022 Project scope statement (updates) \n\n\n\nProject Management for the Oil and Gas Industry \n\n\n\n\u2022 Approved corrective actions \n\n\u2022 Approved preventive actions \n\n\u2022 Approved defect repair \n\n\u2022 Validated defect repair \n\n\u2022 Deliverables \n\nStep 7: Close Project \n\nAt its completion, a project must be formally closed. This involves perform- \ning the project closure portion of the project management plan or closure of \na phase of a multiphase project. There are two main procedures developed to \nestablish interactions necessary to perform the closure function: \n\n\u2022 Administrative closure procedure: This provides details of all activi- \nties, interactions, and related roles and responsibilities involved in \nexecuting the administrative closure of the project. It also covers \nactivities needed to collect project records, analyze project success \nor failure, gather lessons learned, and archive project information. \n\n\u2022 Contract closure procedure: This involves both product verification \nand administrative closure for any existing contract agreements. \nContract closure procedure is an input to the close contract process. \n\nDefinition of Inputs to Step 7: \n\nThe inputs to Step 7 are the following: \n\n\u2022 Project management plan. \n\n\u2022 Contract documentation: This is an input used to perform the \ncontract closure process and includes the contract itself as well as \nchanges to the contract and other documentation, such as technical \napproach, product description, or deliverable acceptance criteria and \nprocedures. \n\n\u2022 Enterprise environmental factors. \n\n\u2022 Organizational process assets. \n\n\u2022 Work performance information. \n\n\u2022 Deliverables, as previously described, and also as approved by the \nintegrated change control process. \n\nDefinition of Tools and Techniques of Step 7: \n\n\u2022 Project management methodology \n\n\u2022 PMIS \n\n\u2022 Expert judgment \n\n\n\nProject Management Body of Knowledge 87 \n\n\n\nDefinition of Outputs of Step 7: \n\n\u2022 Administrative closure procedure \n\n\u2022 Procedures to transfer the project products or services to pro- \nduction and/or operations are developed and established at this \nstage \n\n\u2022 This stage covers a step-by-step methodology for administrative \nclosure that addresses the following: \n\n- Actions and activities to define the stakeholder approval \nrequirements for changes and all levels of deliverables \n\n- Actions and activities confirm project has met all sponsor, \ncustomer, and other stakeholders' requirements \n\n- Actions and activities to verify that all deliverables have been \nprovided and accepted \n\n- Actions and activities to validate completion and exit criteria \nfor the project \n\n\u2022 Contract closure procedure \n\n\u2022 This stage provides a step-by-step methodology that addresses \nthe terms and conditions of the contracts and any required com- \npletion or exit criteria for contract closure \n\n\u2022 Actions performed at this stage formally close all contracts asso- \nciated with the completed project \n\n\u2022 Final product, service, or result \n\n\u2022 Formal acceptance and handover of the final product, service, or \nresult that the project was authorized to provide \n\n\u2022 Formal statement confirming that the terms of the contract have \nbeen met \n\n\u2022 Organizational process assets (updates) \n\n\u2022 Development of the index and location of project documentation \nusing the configuration management system \n\n\u2022 Formal acceptance documentation, which formally indicates the \ncustomer or sponsor has officially accepted the deliverables \n\n\u2022 Project files, which contain all documentation resulting from the \nproject activities \n\n\u2022 Project closure documents, which consist of a formal documen- \ntation indicating the completion of the project and transfer of \ndeliverables \n\n\u2022 Historical information, which is transferred to knowledge base \nof lessons learned for use by future projects \n\n\u2022 Traceability of process steps \n\n\n\nProject Management for the Oil and Gas Industry \n\n\n\nProject Sustainability \n\nProject efforts must be sustained for a project to achieve the intended end \nresults in the long run. Project sustainability is not often addressed in project \nmanagement, but it is very essential particularly for projects in the oil and \ngas industry. \n\nSustainability, in ordinary usage, refers to the capacity to maintain a cer- \ntain process or state indefinitely. In day-to-day parlance, the concept of sus- \ntainability is applied more specifically to living organisms and systems, \nparticularly environmental systems. As applied to the human community, \nsustainability has been expressed as meeting the needs of the present with- \nout compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. \nThe term has its roots in ecology as the ability of an ecosystem to main- \ntain ecological processes, functions, biodiversity, and productivity into the \nfuture. When applied to systems, sustainability brings out the conventional \nattributes of a system in terms of having the following capabilities: \n\n\u2022 Self-regulation \n\n\u2022 Self-adjustment \n\n\u2022 Self-correction \n\n\u2022 Self-recreation \n\nTo be sustainable, nature's resources must only be used at a rate at which \nthey can be replenished naturally. Within the environmental science com- \nmunity, there is a strong belief that the world is progressing on an unsustain- \nable path because the Earth's limited natural resources are being consumed \nmore rapidly than they are being replaced by nature. Consequently, a collec- \ntive human effort to keep human use of natural resources within the sustain- \nable development aspect of the Earth's finite resource limits has become an \nissue of urgent importance. Unsustainable management of natural resources \nputs the Earth's future in jeopardy. \n\nSustainability has become a widespread, controversial, and complex issue \nthat is applied in many different ways, including the following: \n\n\u2022 Sustainability of ecological systems or biological organization (e.g., \nwetlands, prairies, forests) \n\n\u2022 Sustainability of human organization (e.g., ecovillages, eco-munici- \npalities, sustainable cities) \n\n\u2022 Sustainability of human activities and disciplines (e.g., sustainable \nagriculture, sustainable architecture, sustainable energy) \n\n\u2022 Sustainability of projects (e.g., operations, resource allocation, cost \ncontrol) \n\nFor project integration, the concept of sustainability can be applied to facil- \nitate collaboration across project entities. The process of achieving continued \n\n\n\nProject Management Body of Knowledge \n\n\n\nimprovement in operations, in a sustainable way, requires that engineers \ncreate new technologies that facilitate interdisciplinary thought exchanges. \nUnder the project methodology of this book sustainability means asking \nquestions that relate to the consistency and long-term execution of the proj- \nect plan. Essential questions that should be addressed include the following: \n\n\u2022 Is the project plan supportable under current operating conditions? \n\n\u2022 Will the estimated cost remain stable within some tolerance bounds? \n\n\u2022 Are human resources skills able to keep up with the ever-changing \nrequirements of a complex project? \n\n\u2022 Will the project team persevere toward the project goal, through \nboth rough and smooth times? \n\n\u2022 Will interest and enthusiasm for the project be sustained beyond the \ninitial euphoria? \n\nFigure 3.10 illustrates a potential distribution of how organizations \nembrace the tools and techniques of project management. The innovators \nare those who are always on the cutting edge of the applications of proj- \nect management. They find creative ways to use existing tools and invest in \ncreating new and enhanced tools. The early adopters are those who capital- \nize on using project management whenever an opportunity develops. Early \nchampions are those who provide support for and encourage the applica- \ntion of project management. Most managers will fall in this category. Late \nchampions are those who say \"show me the money\" and I will believe. They \neventually come around to the side of project management once they see and \nexperience the benefits directly. The laggards are those who remain obsti- \nnate no matter what. They deprive themselves of the structured benefits of \nproject management. This is where organizations should focus more efforts \nto encourage the laggards to move in the direction of embracing and apply- \ning project management. \n\n\n\n\nFIGURE 3.10 \n\nPercentage categories of how organizations embrace project management. \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\n\nOil and Gas Project Communication \n\n\n\nCommunication is the foundation of project success. \n\nCommunication is vital to everything in a project (Mooz and Howard, 2003). \nAny successful project manager would spend 90% of his or her time on com- \nmunication activities. This is a vital function that is even more crucial in the oil \nand gas business because of the multitude of stakeholders. Communications \nmanagement refers to the functional interface between individuals and \ngroups within the project environment. This involves proper organization, \nrouting, and control of information needed to facilitate work. Good commu- \nnication is in effect when there is a common understanding of information \nbetween the communicator and the target. Communications management \nfacilitates unity of purpose in the project environment. The success of a proj- \nect is directly related to the effectiveness of project communication. \n\nThe project team should employ all possible avenues to get the project \ninformation across to everyone. \n\n\n\nCommunications Management: Step-by-Step Implementation \n\nThe communications management component of the PMBOK consists of the \nfour elements shown below: \n\nStep 1: Communications planning \nStep 2: Information distribution \nStep 3: Performance reporting \nStep 4: Manage stakeholders \n\nTable 4.1 shows an implementation of communications management across \nthe process groups of project management. Tables 4.2 through 4.5 present the \ninputs, tools, techniques, and outputs of each step of communications man- \nagement. Communications planning involves determining the information \nand communication needs of the stakeholders regarding who needs what \ninformation, when, where, and how. Information distribution involves mak- \ning the needed information available to project stakeholders in a timely man- \nner and in appropriate dosage. Performance reporting involves collecting \n\n91 \n\n\n\n92 \n\n\n\nProject Management for the Oil and Gas Industry \n\n\n\nTABLE 4.1 \n\nImplementation of Communications Management across Process Groups \n\nMonitoring and \nInitiating Planning Executing Controlling Closing \n\n\n\nProject communications \nmanagement \n\n\n\n1 .

Managing stakeholders involves \nmanaging communications to satisfy the requirements of the stakeholders so \nas to resolve issues that develop. \n\n\n\nComplexity of Multiperson Communication \n\nCommunication complexity increases with an increase in the number of \ncommunication channels. It is one thing to wish to communicate freely, but it \nis another thing to contend with the increased complexity when more people \nare involved. The statistical formula of combination can be used to estimate \nthe complexity of communication as a function of the number of communi- \ncation channels or number of participants. The combination formula is used \n\n\n\nTABLE 4.2 \n\nTools and Techniques for Communications Planning within Project \nCommunications Management \n\nStep 1: Communications Planning \n\n\n\nInputs \n\n\n\nTools and Techniques \n\n\n\nOutput(s) \n\n\n\nEnterprise environmental \n\nfactors \nOrganizational process assets \n\n\n\nProject scope statement \n\nProject constraints and \n\nassumptions \nOther in-house (custom) factors \n\nof relevance and interest \n\n\n\nCommunications \nrequirement analysis \n\nCommunications \ntechnology \n\n\n\nCommunications \n\nresponsibility matrix \nCollaborative alliance \n\nOther in-house (custom) \ntools and techniques \n\n\n\nCommunications \n\nmanagement plan \nOther in-house outputs, \n\nreports, and data inferences \n\nof interest to the \n\norganization \n\n\n\nOil and Gas Project Communication \n\n\n\n93 \n\n\n\nTABLE 4.3 \n\nTools and Techniques for Information Distribution within Project Communications \nManagement \n\nStep 2: Information Distribution \n\n\n\nInputs \n\n\n\nTools and Techniques \n\n\n\nOutput(s) \n\n\n\nCommunications \n\nmanagement plan \nPersonnel distribution list \n\n\n\nOther in-house (custom) \nfactors of relevance and \ninterest \n\n\n\nCommunication modes and \n\nskills \nSocial networking \n\n\n\nInfluence networking \n\n\n\nMeetings and dialogues \nCommunication relationships \nInformation gathering and \n\nretrieval systems \nInformation distribution \n\nmethods \nLessons learned \nBest practices \nInformation Eexchange \nOther in-house (custom) \n\ntools and techniques \n\n\n\nOrganizational process assets \n(updates) \n\nOther in-house outputs, \nreports, and data inferences \nof interest to the organization \n\n\n\nTABLE 4.4 \n\nTools and Techniques for Performance Reporting within Project Communications \nManagement \n\n\n\nInputs \n\n\n\nStep 3: Performance Reporting \nTools and Techniques \n\n\n\nOutput(s) \n\n\n\nWork performance \n\ninformation \nPerformance \n\nmeasurements \nForecasted completion \nQuality control \n\nmeasurements \nProject performance \n\nmeasurement baseline \nApproved change \n\nrequests \n\nList of deliverables \n\nOther in-house (custom) \nfactors of relevance and \ninterest \n\n\n\nInformation presentation \n\ntools \nPerformance information \n\ngathering and compilation \nStatus review meetings \nTime reporting systems \n\nCost reporting systems \n\n\n\nOther in-house (custom) \ntools and techniques \n\n\n\nPerformance reports \n\nForecasts \n\nRequested changes \nRecommended corrective \n\nactions \nOrganizational process assets \n\nOther in-house outputs, \nreports, and data inferences \nof interest to the organization \n\n\n\n94 \n\n\n\nProject Management for the Oil and Gas Industry \n\n\n\nTABLE 4.5 \n\nTools and Techniques for Managing Stakeholders within Project Communications \nManagement \n\nStep 4: Manage Stakeholders \n\n\n\nInputs \n\n\n\nTools and Techniques \n\n\n\nOutput(s) \n\n\n\nCommunications \n\nmanagement plan \nOrganizational process assets \nOther in-house (custom) \n\nfactors of relevance and \n\ninterest \n\n\n\nCommunications methods Resolved issues \n\n\n\nIssue logs \n\nOther in-house (custom) \ntools and techniques \n\n\n\nConflict resolution report \nApproved change requests \n\n\n\nApproved corrective actions \nOrganizational process assets \n\n(updates) \nOther in-house outputs, \nreports, and data inferences \nof interest to the organization \n\n\n\nto calculate the number of possible combinations of r objects from a set of n \nobjects. This is written as \n\n\n\nC \n\n\n\nn\\ \n\n\n\nr\\[n - r]\\ \n\n\n\n(4.1) \n\n\n\nIn the case of communication, for illustration purposes, we assume that \ncommunication is between two members of a team at a time. That is, com- \nbination of two from n team members. That is, the number of possible com- \nbinations of two members out of a team of n people. Thus, the formula for \ncommunication complexity reduces to the expression below, after some of \nthe computation factors cancel out: \n\n\n\n&lt;S~i \n\n\n\nn(n - 1) \n2 \n\n\n\n(4.2) \n\n\n\nIn a similar vein, Badiru (2008) introduced a formula for cooperation com- \nplexity based on the statistical concept of permutation. Permutation is the \nnumber of possible arrangements of k objects taken from a set of n objects. \nThe permutation formula is written as \n\n\n\nn\\ \n\n\n\n(n-k)\\ \n\n\n\n(4.3) \n\n\n\nThus, for the number of possible permutations of two members out of a \nteam of n members is estimated as \n\n\n\nOil and Gas Project Communication \n\n\n\n95 \n\n\n\nComplexity level \n\n\n\nCooperation complexity \n\n\n\n\n: n(n-l) \n\n\n\nri ! \u00ab(\u00ab-l) \n\nCommunication complexity \n\n\n\nNumber of participants \n\nFIGURE 4.1 \n\nPlots of communication and cooperation complexities. \n\nn P 2 = n(n-l) \n\n\n\n(4.4) \n\n\n\nThe permutation formula is used for cooperation because cooperation is \nbidirectional. Full cooperation requires that if A cooperates with B, then B \nmust cooperate with A. But A cooperating with B does not necessarily imply \nB cooperating with A. In notational form, that is \n\nA \u2014 &gt; B does not necessarily imply B \u2014 &gt; A. \n\nFigure 4.1 shows the relative plots of communication complexity and coop- \neration complexity as function of project team size, n. It is seen that complex- \nity increases rapidly as the number of communication participants increases. \nCoordination complexity is even more exponential as the number of team \nmembers increases. Interested readers can derive their own coordination \ncomplexity formula based on the standard combination and permutation \nformulas or other statistical measures. The complexity formulas indicate a \nneed for a more structured approach to implement the techniques of project \nmanagement. The communications templates and guidelines presented in \nthis chapter are useful for the general management of STEP projects. Each \nspecific project implementation must adapt the guidelines to the prevailing \nscenario and constraints of a project. \n\n\n\nUsing the Triple C Model \n\nThe Triple C model of communication, cooperation, and coordination pre- \nsented by Badiru (2008) is a viable tool for ensuring effective communi- \ncation in the project environment. The Triple C model states that project \n\n\n\n96 Project Management for the Oil and Gas Industry \n\n\n\nmanagement can be enhanced by implementing it within the following inte- \ngrated and hierarchical processes: \n\n\u2022 Communication \n\n\u2022 Cooperation \n\n\u2022 Coordination \n\nThe model facilitates a systematic approach to project planning, organiz- \ning, scheduling, and control. The Triple C model requires communication to \nbe the first and foremost function in the project endeavor. The model explic- \nitly provides an avenue to address questions such as the following: \n\nWhen will the project be accomplished? \nWhich tools are available for the project? \nWhat training is needed for the project execution? \nWhat resources are available for the project? \nWho will participate on the project team? \n\nFigure 4.2 illustrates the three elements of the Triple C model with respect \nto cost, schedule, and performance improvement goals. \n\nFigure 4.3 presents a framework for the application of the Triple C model \nwithin PMBOK. \n\nTriple C highlights what must be done and when. It can also help to iden- \ntify the resources (personnel, equipment, facilities, etc.) required for each \n\n\n\nCommunication \n\n\n\nFIGURE 4.2 \n\nTriple C for planning, scheduling, and control. \n\n\n\nOil and Gas Project Communication \n\n\n\n97 \n\n\n\n\nFIGURE 4.3 \n\nImplementing Triple C within PMBOK. \n\neffort in the project. It points out important questions such as \n\n\u2022 Does each project participant know what the objective is? \n\n\u2022 Does each participant know his or her role in achieving the objective? \n\n\u2022 What obstacles may prevent a participant from playing his or her \nrole effectively? \n\nTriple C can mitigate disparity between idea and practice because it explic- \nitly solicits information about the critical aspects of a project. The different \ntypes of communication, cooperation, and coordination are outlined below. \n\nTypes of communication: \n\n\u2022 Verbal \n\n\u2022 Written \n\n\u2022 Body language \n\n\u2022 Visual tools (e.g., graphical tools) \n\n\u2022 Sensual (use of all five senses: sight, smell, touch, taste, and hearing \u2014 \nolfactory, tactile, and auditory) \n\n\u2022 Simplex (unidirectional) \n\n\n\n98 Project Management for the Oil and Gas Industry \n\n\n\n\u2022 Half-duplex (bidirectional with time lag) \n\n\u2022 Full-duplex (real-time dialogue) \n\n\u2022 One-on-one \n\n\u2022 One-to-many \n\n\u2022 Many- to -one \n\nTypes of cooperation: \n\n\u2022 Proximity \n\n\u2022 Functional \n\n\u2022 Professional \n\n\u2022 Social \n\n\u2022 Romantic \n\n\u2022 Power influence \n\n\u2022 Authority influence \n\n\u2022 Hierarchical \n\n\u2022 Lateral \n\n\u2022 Cooperation by intimidation \n\n\u2022 Cooperation by enticement \n\nTypes of coordination: \n\n\u2022 Teaming \n\n\u2022 Delegation \n\n\u2022 Supervision \n\n\u2022 Partnership \n\n\u2022 Token-passing \n\n\u2022 Baton hand-off \n\n\n\nTypical Triple C Questions \n\nQuestioning is the best approach to getting information for effective project \nmanagement. Everything should be questioned. By upfront questions, we \ncan preempt and avert project problems later on. The typical questions to ask \nunder Triple C approach are: \n\n\u2022 What is the purpose of the project? \n\n\u2022 Who is in charge of the project? \n\n\n\nOil and Gas Project Communication 99 \n\n\n\nWhy is the project needed? \n\nWhere is the project located? \n\nWhen will the project be carried out? \n\nHow will the project contribute to increased opportunities for the \norganization? \n\nWhat is the project designed to achieve? \n\nHow will the project affect different groups of people within the \norganization? \n\nWhat will be the project approach or methodology? \n\nWhat other groups or organizations will be involved (if any)? \n\nWhat will happen at the end of the project? \n\nHow will the project be tracked, monitored, evaluated, and reported? \n\nWhat resources are required? \n\nWhat are the associated costs of the required resources? \n\nHow do the project objectives fit the goal of the organization? \n\nWhat respective contribution is expected from each participant? \n\nWhat level of cooperation is expected from each group? \n\nWhere is the coordinating point for the project? \n\n\n\nHow to Accomplish Triple C Communication \n\nCommunication makes working together possible. The communication \nfunction of project management involves making all those concerned \nbecome aware of project requirements and progress. Those who will \nbe affected by the project directly or indirectly, as direct participants \nor as beneficiaries, should be informed as appropriate regarding the \nfollowing: \n\n\u2022 Scope of the project \n\n\u2022 Personnel contribution required \n\n\u2022 Expected cost and merits of the project \n\n\u2022 Project organization and implementation plan \n\n\u2022 Potential adverse effects if the project should fail \n\n\u2022 Alternatives, if any, for achieving the project goal \n\n\u2022 Potential direct and indirect benefits of the project \n\n\n\n100 Project Management for the Oil and Gas Industry \n\n\n\nThe communication channel must be kept open throughout the project life \ncycle. In addition to internal communication, appropriate external sources \nshould also be consulted. The project manager must: \n\n\u2022 Exude commitment to the project \n\n\u2022 Utilize the communication responsibility matrix \n\n\u2022 Facilitate multichannel communication interfaces \n\n\u2022 Identify internal and external communication needs \n\n\u2022 Resolve organizational and communication hierarchies \n\n\u2022 Encourage both formal and informal communication links \n\nWhen clear communication is maintained between management and \nemployees and among peers, many project problems can be averted. Project \ncommunication may be carried out in one or more of the following formats: \n\n\u2022 One-to-many \n\n\u2022 One-to-one \n\n\u2022 Many- to -one \n\n\u2022 Written and formal \n\n\u2022 Written and informal \n\n\u2022 Oral and formal \n\n\u2022 Oral and informal \n\n\u2022 Nonverbal gestures \n\nGood communication is affected when what is implied is perceived as \nintended. Effective communications are vital to the success of any project. \nDespite the awareness that proper communications form the blueprint for \nproject success, many organizations still fail in their communications func- \ntions. The study of communication is complex. Factors that influence the \neffectiveness of communication within a project organization structure \ninclude the following: \n\n1. Personal perception. Each person perceives events on the basis of per- \nsonal psychological, social, cultural, and experimental background. \nAs a result, no two people can interpret a given event the same way. \nThe nature of events is not always the critical aspect of a problem \nsituation. Rather, the problem is often the different perceptions of \nthe different people involved. \n\n2. Psychological profile. The psychological makeup of each person deter- \nmines personal reactions to events or words. Thus, individual needs \nand level of thinking will dictate how a message is interpreted. \n\n\n\nOil and Gas Project Communication 101 \n\n\n\n3. Social environment. Communication problems sometimes arise because \npeople have been conditioned by their prevailing social environ- \nment to interpret certain things in unique ways. Vocabulary idioms, \norganizational status, social stereotypes, and economic situation are \namong the social factors that can thwart effective communication. \n\n4. Cultural background. Cultural differences are among the most perva- \nsive barriers to project communications, especially in today's multi- \nnational organizations. Language and cultural idiosyncrasies often \ndetermine how communication is approached and interpreted. \n\n5. Semantic and syntactic factors. Semantic and syntactic barriers to \ncommunications usually occur in written documents. Semantic \nfactors are those that relate to the intrinsic knowledge of the \nsubject of communication. Syntactic factors are those that relate \nto the form in which the communication is presented. The prob- \nlems created by these factors become acute in situations where \nresponse, feedback, or reaction to the communication cannot be \nobserved. \n\n6. Organizational structure. Frequently, the organization structure in \nwhich a project is conducted has a direct influence on the flow of \ninformation and, consequently, on the effectiveness of communica- \ntion. Organization hierarchy may determine how different person- \nnel levels perceive a given communication. \n\n7. Communication media. The method of transmitting a message may \nalso affect the value ascribed to the message and consequently, how \nit is interpreted or used. The common barriers to project communi- \ncations are: \n\nInattentiveness \n\nLack of organization \n\nOutstanding grudges \n\nPreconceived notions \n\nAmbiguous presentation \n\nEmotions and sentiments \n\nLack of communication feedback \n\nSloppy and unprofessional presentation \n\nLack of confidence in the communicator \n\nLack of confidence by the communicator \n\nLow credibility of the communicator \n\nUnnecessary technical jargon \n\nToo many people involved \n\nUntimely communication \n\n\n\n102 Project Management for the Oil and Gas Industry \n\n\n\n\u2022 Arrogance or imposition \n\n\u2022 Lack of focus \n\nSome suggestions on improving the effectiveness of communication are \npresented next. The recommendations may be implemented as appropriate \nfor any of the forms of communications listed earlier. The recommendations \nare for both the communicator and the audience. \n\n1. Never assume that the integrity of the information sent will be pre- \nserved as the information passes through several communication \nchannels. Information is generally filtered, condensed, or expanded \nby the receivers before relaying it to the next destination. While \npreparing a communication that needs to pass through several \norganization structures, one safeguard is to compose the original \ninformation in a concise form to minimize the need for recomposi- \ntion of the project structure. \n\n2. Give the audience a central role in the discussion. A leading role can \nhelp make a person feel a part of the project effort and responsible \nfor the projects' success. One can then have a more constructive view \nof project communication. \n\n3. Do homework and think through the intended accomplishment of \nthe communication. This helps eliminate trivial and inconsequential \ncommunication efforts. \n\n4. Carefully plan the organization of the ideas embodied in the com- \nmunication. Use indexing or points of reference whenever possible. \nGrouping ideas into related chunks of information can be particu- \nlarly effective. Present the short messages first. Short messages help \ncreate focus, maintain interest, and prepare the mind for the longer \nmessages to follow. \n\n5. Highlight why the communication is of interest and how it is \nintended to be used. Full attention should be given to the content of \nthe message with regard to the prevailing project situation. \n\n6. Elicit the support of those around you by integrating their ideas into \ncommunication. The more people feel that they have contributed to \nthe issue, the more expeditious they are in soliciting the coopera- \ntion of others. The effect of the multiplicative rule can quickly garner \nsupport for the communication purpose. \n\n7. Be responsive to the feelings of others. It takes two to communicate. \nAnticipate and appreciate the reactions of members of the audience. \nRecognize their operational circumstances and present your mes- \nsage in a form they can relate to. \n\n8. Accept constructive criticism. Nobody is infallible. Use criticism as a \nspringboard to higher communication performance. \n\n\n\nOil and Gas Project Communication 103 \n\n\n\n9. Exhibit interest in the issue to arouse the interest of your audience. \nAvoid delivering your messages as a matter of a routine organiza- \ntional requirement. \n\n10. Obtain and furnish feedback promptly. Clarify vague points with \nexamples. \n\n11. Communicate at the appropriate time, at the right place, and to the \nright people. \n\n12. Reinforce words with positive action. Never promise what cannot be \ndelivered. Value your credibility. \n\n13. Maintain eye contact in oral communication and read the facial \nexpressions of your audience to obtain real-time feedback. \n\n14. Concentrate on listening as much as speaking. Evaluate both the \nimplicit and explicit meanings of statements. \n\n15. Document communication transactions for future references. \n\n16. Avoid asking questions that can be answered yes or no. Use relevant \nquestions to focus the attention of the audience. Use questions that \nmake people reflect upon their words, such as, \"How do you think \nthis will work?\" compared to \"Do you think this will work?\" \n\n17. Avoid patronizing the audience. Respect their judgment and \nknowledge. \n\n18. Speak and write in a controlled tempo. Avoid emotionally charged \nvoice inflections. \n\n19. Create an atmosphere for formal and informal exchange of ideas. \n\n20. Summarize the objectives of the communication and how they will \nbe achieved. \n\n\n\nSMART Communication \n\nThe key to getting everyone on board with a project is to ensure that task \nobjectives are clear and comply with the principle of SMART as outlined \nbelow: \n\nSpecific: The task objective must be specific. \n\nMeasurable: The task objective must be measurable. \n\nAligned: The task objective must be achievable and aligned with an \noverall project goal. \n\nRealistic: The task objective must be realistic and relevant to the \norganization. \n\nTimed: The task objective must have a time basis. \n\n\n\n104 Project Management for the Oil and Gas Industry \n\n\n\nIf a task has the above intrinsic characteristics, then the function of commu- \nnicating the task will more likely lead to personnel cooperation. A communi- \ncation responsibility matrix shows the linking of sources of communication \nand targets of communication. The cells within the matrix indicate the sub- \nject of the desired communication. There should be at least one filled cell in \neach row and each column of the matrix. This assures that each individual \nof a department has at least one communication source or a target associated \nwith him or her. With a communication responsibility matrix, a clear under- \nstanding of what needs to be communicated to whom can be developed. \nCommunication in a project environment can take any of several forms. The \nspecific needs of a project may dictate the most appropriate mode. Three \npopular computer communication modes are discussed next in the context \nof communicating data and information for project management. \n\nSimplex communication. This is a unidirectional communication arrange- \nment in which one project entity initiates communication with another \nentity or individual within the project environment. The entity addressed \nin the communication does not have a mechanism or capability for respond- \ning to the communication. An extreme example of this is a one-way, top- \ndown communication from the top management to the project personnel. \nIn this case, the personnel have no communication access or input to the top \nmanagement. A budget-related example is a case where the top management \nallocates budget to a project without requesting and reviewing the actual \nneeds of the project. Simplex communication is common in authoritarian \norganizations. \n\nHalf-duplex communication. This is a bidirectional communication arrange- \nment whereby one project entity can communicate with another entity and \nreceive a response within a certain time lag. Both entities can communicate \nwith each other but not at the same time. An example of half-duplex com- \nmunication is a project organization that permits communication with the \ntop management without a direct meeting. Each communicator must wait \nfor a response from the target of the communication. Request and allocation \nwithout a budget meeting is another example of half-duplex data communi- \ncation in project management. \n\nFull-duplex communication. This involves a communication arrangement that \npermits a dialogue between the communicating entities. Both individuals \nand entities can communicate with each other at the same time or face-to-face. \nAs long as there is no clash of words, this appears to be the most receptive \ncommunication mode. It allows participative project planning in which each \nproject personnel has an opportunity to contribute to the planning process. \n\nEach member of a project team needs to recognize the nature of the pre- \nvailing communication mode in the project. The management must evaluate \nthe prevailing communication structure and attempt to modify it if neces- \nsary to enhance the project functions. An evaluation of who is to communi- \ncate with whom about what may help improve the project data/information \ncommunication process. A communication matrix may include notations \n\n\n\nOil and Gas Project Communication 105 \n\n\n\nabout the desired modes of communication between individuals and groups \nin the project environment. \n\n\n\nHow to Achieve Cooperation \n\nThe cooperation of team members should never be taken for granted. It must \nbe explicitly elicited and facilitated. Good project communication is what is \nneeded to facilitate cooperation. Merely voicing consent for a project is not \nenough assurance of full cooperation. Most off-the-cuff expression of coopera- \ntion is just \"faking it.\" A project buy-in or sign-off that does not have a solid \nfoundation of communication is groundless. Project participants and benefi- \nciaries must be convinced of the merits of the project. That is how intrinsic \nand sustainable cooperation can be achieved. Some of the factors that influ- \nence cooperation in a project environment include personnel requirements, \nresource requirements, budget limitations, past experiences, conflicting priori- \nties, and lack of uniform organizational support. As the lead author often says: \n\nOur level of willing involvement and participation on project is shaped by \npast experiences. \n\nWe should, thus, leverage successful cooperation on one project to build \ncooperative groundwork to future project alliances. A structured approach \nto seeking cooperation should clarify the following: \n\n\u2022 Cooperative efforts required \n\n\u2022 Precedents for future projects \n\n\u2022 Implication of lack of cooperation \n\n\u2022 Criticality of cooperation to project success \n\n\u2022 Organizational impact of cooperation \n\n\u2022 Time frame involved in the project \n\n\u2022 Rewards of good cooperation \n\nCooperation is a basic virtue of human interaction. More projects fail due \nto a lack of cooperation and commitment than any other project factors. To \nsecure and retain the cooperation of the project participants, you must elicit \na positive first reaction to the project. The most positive aspects of a project \nshould be the first items of project communication. For project management, \nthere are different types of cooperation that should be understood. \n\nFunctional cooperation. This is cooperation induced by the nature of the func- \ntional relationship between two groups. The two groups may be required to \nperform related functions that can only be accomplished through mutual \ncooperation. \n\n\n\n106 Project Management for the Oil and Gas Industry \n\n\n\nSocial cooperation. This is the type of cooperation effected by the social rela- \ntionship between two groups. The prevailing social relationship motivates \ncooperation that may be useful in getting the project work done. \n\nLegal cooperation. Legal cooperation is the type of cooperation that is \nimposed through some authoritative requirement. In this case, the partici- \npants may have no choice other than to cooperate. \n\nAdministrative cooperation. This is cooperation brought on by administra- \ntive requirements that make it imperative that two groups work together on \na common goal. \n\nAssociative cooperation. This type of cooperation may also be referred to as \ncollegiality The level of cooperation is determined by the association that \nexists between two groups. \n\nProximity cooperation.

The \nprinciples presented in the SAPs are supported by a suite of guides to further assist \nONR\u2019s inspectors in their technical assessment work in support of making regulatory \njudgements and decisions.  This technical assessment guide is one of these guides. \n\n2. \n\nPURPOSE AND SCOPE \n\nThe purpose of this technical assessment guide is to provide an interpretation of those \nSafety Assessment Principles (Ref 6.1) related to PSA and to provide specific \nguidance to inspectors engaged in the assessment of PSAs and PSA related \nsubmissions (from Licensees, Licence Applicants or Generic Design Assessment \n(GDA) Requesting Parties. All these are referred to as dutyholders in this TAG).  \n\nThe \u201cSAPs addressed\u201d section of this TAG concentrates on interpretation of the SAPs; \ngeneral guidance on the assessment of PSA is given in the \u201cAdvice to inspectors\u201d \nsection. Detailed guidance on the assessment of PSA specific to Nuclear Power Plants \n(NPPs) is provided in Appendix 1.  \n\nAs with all guidance, inspectors should use their judgement and discretion in the depth \nand scope to which they apply the guidance provided in this TAG and its Appendix 1.  \n\nThis TAG does not provide detailed information on how to judge the technical \nadequacy of the various PSA aspects assessed. The reviewers should use their own \nknowledge and experience for this. However, aid can be sought in the publications \nlisted in Sections 5, 6, 7 and in Appendix 1.  \n\nIt is not the intention of this guide to prescribe specific methods and approaches for \nconducting PSA. Dutyholders may choose to use alternative methods to those covered \nby this TAG (and in particular its Appendix 1) as long as they lead to equally valid \noutcomes. In cases where the PSA or specific areas of it have been undertaken using \nalternative approaches inspectors should review them on a case-by-case basis and \njudge them on their own merits. External expert support may be sought if necessary. \n\nIn addition, it should be noted that PSA covers a whole range of disciplines and, \ntherefore, PSA assessment requires involvement of inspectors with in-depth expertise \nin a range of areas such as fault studies and thermal-hydraulic analysis, mechanical, \nelectrical and C&I systems, civil engineering, human factors, software reliability, \nstructural integrity, internal and external hazards, severe accident and radiation safety. \nOn the other hand, individual assessments of said areas of the safety case can benefit \nfrom, and should take advantage of, the insights the PSA provides on the relative \nimportance of issues addressed in those technical areas. \n\nInspectors must be able to form an opinion on whether risks are ALARP and it is not \nunreasonable to expect numerical input to the demonstration that the risk is ALARP. \nNS-TAST-GD-051 (Ref 7.10) provides further guidance on the role of PSA within \nsafety cases and NS-TAST-GD-005 (Ref 7.1) provides further guidance on the role of \nPSA in the demonstration of ALARP. \n\nAlthough this TAG does not specifically cover PSA for the risk to persons on-site from \nnuclear accidents, it provides sufficient information to help inspectors assessing the \nPSA inputs for this particular aspect of the safety case provided by the dutyholders.  \nPSA\u2019s primary focus is usually to assess off-site risks; however PSA may be used to \n\nReport : NS-TAST-GD-030 \nCM9 Ref: 2018/408246 \n\nPage 2 of 81 \n\n \n \n\n\fOffice for Nuclear Regulation  \n \n \n\nprovide an input to assessment of on-site risk and comparison against Numerical \nTargets 5 and 6.  \n\n3. \n\nRELATIONSHIP TO LICENCE AND OTHER RELEVANT LEGISLATION  \n\n3.1 \n\n3.2 \n\n3.3 \n\n3.4 \n\n3.5 \n\n3.6 \n\nThe site licence conditions give a legal framework which can be drawn on in \nassessment and are, in general, set out in the form of requiring the licensee to make \nadequate arrangements, in the interests of safety, to secure certain objectives. The \nprincipal licence conditions (LCs) relevant to PSA are LC14, LC15, LC23, LC24, LC27 \nand LC28. \n\nLC14 requires the licensee to make and implement adequate arrangements for the \nproduction and assessment of safety cases. Normally, the licensee\u2019s safety case will \nneed to contain PSA as well as deterministic analysis. \n\nLC15 sets out the requirements for periodic review and reassessment of safety cases. \nThe periodic reviews carried out under these arrangements include those for updating / \nextending the PSA (or producing one, if none previously existing, and comparison with \nrelevant good practice) and using it to support the arguments for continuing operation \nduring the period until the next review. \n\nLC23 requires that the safety case identifies the conditions and limits necessary in the \ninterest of safety and it is ONR\u2019s expectation that both the probabilistic (PSA) and the \ndeterministic aspects of the safety case will contribute to this process. Similarly, ONR \nexpects that PSA will contribute to the identification of suitable and sufficient safety \nmechanisms, devices and circuits, as required by LC27 and provide a significant input \nfor LC28 in identifying plant that may affect safety for which regular, systematic \nexamination, inspection, maintenance and testing will be required.  \n\nLC24 requires the licensee to ensure that all operating instructions which may affect \nsafety are written down and include all operating instructions that are necessary in the \ninterests of safety.  Thus, ONR expects the PSA to be well documented, wide in scope \nand of high fidelity. \n\nIn addition to these principal licence conditions, LC6 requires that adequate records be \nmade and maintained. In this regard, it is ONR\u2019s expectation that licensees will \nestablish Living PSA programmes and that, in the framework of these programmes, all \nrelevant files and records will be maintained for the life of the facility.  Also, LC 17 sets \nout the requirement for quality assurance (QA) arrangements for all matters that affect \nsafety. In this respect Licensees are expected to establish an adequate QA process \nthat is effectively applied during all phases of the PSA and its application.   \n\n3.7 \n\nSafety cases, including PSA, may be produced to support activities such as \nconstruction of new facilities, commissioning, modifications and decommissioning. \nThese activities, covered by licence conditions 19, 20, 21, 22 and 35, require safety \ndocumentation. \n\n4. \n\nSAPS ADDRESSED AND RELATIONSHIP WITH WENRA REFERENCE LEVELS \nAND IAEA STANDARDS \n\n4.1 \n\nIntroduction \n\nThis  guide  interprets  ONR\u2019s  use  of  the  PSA  related  safety  assessment  principles  as \nset out in ONR\u2019s SAPs (Ref 6.1) FA.1, and FA.10 to FA.14. This guide also addresses \nthose  aspects  of  the  principles  on  \u2018assurance  of  validity',  AV.1  to  AV.8,  that  are \nspecifically  applicable  to  PSA.    Numerical  targets  related  to  PSA  are  explained  more \nfully in annex 2 of the SAPs, and predominantly relate to Targets 7, 8 and 9. \n\nReport : NS-TAST-GD-030 \nCM9 Ref: 2018/408246 \n\nPage 3 of 81 \n\n \n \n\n\fOffice for Nuclear Regulation  \n \n \n\n4.2 \n\nFault analysis: general \u2013 Design basis analysis, PSA and severe accident analysis \u2013 \nFA.1 \n\n\u201cFault analysis should be carried out comprising suitable and sufficient design \nbasis analysis, PSA and severe accident analysis to demonstrate that risks are \nALARP\u201d  \n\nThis  principle  outlines  the  inter-relationship between  the  three  types  of  fault  analysis, \nDBA,  PSA  and  SAA  and  how  in  combination  they  address  the  range  of  potential \ninitiating  events  (IEs)  with  nuclear  safety  significance  off  the  site.  As  with  DBA  and \nSAA, the scope of PSA should be suitable and sufficient and used along with the other \ntwo  fault  analysis  approaches  to  help  demonstrate  that  risks  are  ALARP  and  to \naddress SAPs Numerical Targets 7, 8 and 9. \n\n4.3 \n\nFault analysis: PSA \u2013 Need for a PSA \u2013 FA.10 \n\n\u201cSuitable  and  sufficient  PSA  should  be  performed  as  part  of  the  fault  analysis \nand design development and analysis\u201d \n\nThis  principle  sets  the  framework  and  requirements  for  a  PSA  study.  The  overriding \naim of the  PSA assessment  is to assist  ONR judgements  on the safety of the facility \nand  whether  the  risks  of  its  operation  are  being  made  as  low  as  reasonably \npracticable.  \n\nThis  TAG  provides  guidance  which  will  enable  inspectors  to  judge  that  the  above \nexpectation for a suitable and sufficient PSA has been met by the dutyholders.  \n\nA PSA should be suitable and sufficient to inform: \n\n1)  A judgement as to the acceptability of the overall risk of the facility against \nthe numerical targets of the SAPs. \n\n2)    A  judgement  that  a  balanced  design  has  been  achieved,  such  that  no \nparticular  class  of  accident  or  feature  of  the  facility  makes  a  disproportionate \n(e.g.,  of  the  order  of  one  tenth  or  greater)  contribution  to  the  risk  target  of \nconcern. However, where risk is low (for example below the BSO), it is unlikely \nthat further engineering measures would be reasonably practicable to address \nany disproportion. \n\n3)    That  the  risks  associated  with  the  design  and  operation  of  the  facility,  as \nwell as changes in risk associated with any modification to plant or operation, \nare and will remain ALARP. \n\nThe depth of the PSA for a given facility may vary depending on the magnitude of the \nradiological  hazard  and  risks  and  the  complexity  of  the  facility.  For  complex  facilities \nsuch  as  nuclear  reactors  or  reprocessing  facilities,  comprehensive  PSAs  that  meet \nmodern standards should be developed for all types of IEs and all operational modes. \n\nIt is relevant to stress that ONR expects ALARP to be integral to all considerations of a \nfacility and site whether new or existing, i.e. it is not a process to be carried out only \nafter a design is completed.  \n\n4.4 \n\nFault analysis: PSA \u2013 Validity \u2013 FA.11 \n\n\u201cPSA should reflect the current design and operation of the facility or site\u201d \n\nThis principle establishes the need for each aspect of the PSA to be directly related to \nexisting  facility  information,  facility documentation  or  the  analysts\u2019  assumptions  in  the \nabsence  of  such  information.  The  PSA  should  be  documented  in  such  a  way  as  to \nallow this principle to be met. \n\nIn addition, in order to meet this principle, the PSA should be kept living, i.e. it should \nbe updated as necessary to reflect the current design and operational features and to \n\nReport : NS-TAST-GD-030 \nCM9 Ref: 2018/408246 \n\nPage 4 of 81 \n\n \n \n\n\fOffice for Nuclear Regulation  \n \n \n\nincorporate  feedback  from  internal  and  external  operational  experience,  improved \nunderstanding  of  physical  processes  or  accident  progression  and  advances  in \nmodelling techniques. \n\n4.5 \n\nFault analysis: PSA \u2013 Scope and extent \u2013 FA.12 \n\n\u201cPSA  should  cover  all  significant  sources  of  radioactivity,  all  permitted \noperating states and all relevant initiating faults\u201d \n\nIn order to meet this principle the scope of the PSA should cover all significant sources \nof  radioactivity  at  the  facility  (e.g.,  fuel  ponds,  fuel  handling  facilities,  waste  storage \ntanks,  radioactive  sources,  reactor  cores,  etc),  all  types  of  IEs  (e.g.,  internal  faults, \ninternal  hazards,  external  hazards)  and  all  operational  modes  (e.g.,  nominal  full \npower/throughput,  low  power/throughput,  shutdown,  start-up,  refuelling,  maintenance \noutages).  Where  the  offsite  consequences  are  potentially  significant,  such  as  for  an \noperating power reactor, the PSA should be at least to level 2 and include all external \nevents  (including  beyond  design  basis  events  that  could  realistically  lead  to  a \nsignificant offsite release (see also SAPs para 618).  \n\n4.6 \n\nFault analysis: PSA \u2013 Adequate representation \u2013 FA.13 \n\n\u201cThe PSA model should provide an adequate representation of the facility and/or \nsite\u201d \n\n1)  General \n\nThe  aim  of  this  principle  is  to  ensure  the  technical  adequacy  of  the  PSA.  Inspectors \nshould  be  satisfied  that  the  PSA  has  a  robust  technical  basis  and  thus  provides  a \ncredible picture of the contributors to the risk from the facility.  \n\nStarting from the list of IEs from SAP FA.2 (Identification of Initiating Faults), the PSA \nshould identify systematically and comprehensively the complete range of sequences \nleading to the \u201cundesired\u201d consequences that may occur. This makes no distinction in \nregard to the frequency at which each sequence is estimated to arise, rather it seeks to \nensure that all conceivable routes to a release are systematically identified.  \n\nIn order to address the relevant numerical targets of the SAPs, the PSA needs to have \nregard  to  accidents  with  severe  consequences  and  to  those  that  have  a  higher \nfrequency but lower radiological consequence.   \n\nWhere  there  are  multiple  units  or  facilities  on  a  site,  the  PSA  should  consider  all \nsignificant  sources  of  radioactivity,  including  any  dependencies  or  potential  for \npropagation of IEs or other effects between different units or facilities.  \n\n2)  PSA Models \n\nPSA  should  account  for  all  contributions  to  the  risk,  including,  but  not  necessarily \nrestricted  to:  random  component  individual  failures,  components  which  are  failed  by \nthe  IE,  common  cause  failures  (CCFs)  (and,  as  necessary,  other  dependent  and \nconsequential  failures),  unavailabilities  due  to  testing  and  maintenance,  pre-initiating \nevent  human errors (e.g., misalignments and mis-calibrations), human errors that lead \nto  IEs  and  human  errors  during  the  course  of  the  accident  sequences  (including \nmisdiagnosis,  decision  errors,  omission  errors  and  commission  errors).  The  potential \ndependencies  between  separate  human  activities  (either  by  the  same  or  by  different \noperators) should be analysed and reflected in the models and probabilities used.   \n\nThe level of detail of PSA should be sufficient to ensure that it is realistic, that the logic \nis correct, that the dependencies are captured, and that the data used is applicable to \nthe  boundary  selected  for  each  (basic)  event  in  the  PSA.  Model  simplifications  (e.g., \nmodelling  of  bounding  sequences,  use  of  super-components)  and  their  justification \nshould  be  clearly  described;  particular  attention  should  be  paid  to  ensuring  that \ndependencies are not missed due to such simplifications. As noted in SAPs para 652, \n\nReport : NS-TAST-GD-030 \nCM9 Ref: 2018/408246 \n\nPage 5 of 81 \n\n \n \n\n\fOffice for Nuclear Regulation  \n \n \n\nthe  PSA  should  model  events  until  a  safe  stable  state  is  reached  and  justify  the \nmission time accordingly. \n\nThe  frequency  of  occurrence  and  consequences  of  each  of  the  fault  sequences \nidentified  should  be  estimated.  Sequences  should  not  be  discounted  solely  on  the \nbasis  that  their  individual  frequency  is  low,  since  the  total  contribution  from  all  low \nfrequency  sequences  may  be  significant  in  respect  to  the  numerical  targets  of  the \nSAPs. \n\nWhere  groups  are  used  to  represent  several  IEs  or  accident  sequences,  the  group \nshould be assigned a frequency equal to the summed frequency of all the contributors \nin the group and should be represented by the most onerous one (i.e. the IE which is \nbounding  in  terms  of  impacts  or  the  sequence  which  is  bounding  in  terms  of \nconsequences). Thus, such simplifications are always conservative. Care needs to be \ntaken to avoid gross conservatism, since it could affect the conclusions drawn from the \nanalysis,  and  could  severely  limit  the  usefulness  of  the  PSA  to  support  decision-\nmaking.  \n\nBest-estimate  methods  and  data  should  be  used  for  the  transient  analyses,  accident \nprogression  analyses,  source  term  analyses,  radiological  analysis  and  any  other \ndeterministic  analyses  that  support  the  PSA.  Where  no  credible  best  estimate  is \npossible, reasonably conservative assumptions should be made and the sensitivity of \nthe  risk  to  these  assumptions  should  be  established.  The  term  \u201cbest-estimate\u201d  is \ndefined in the SAPs Glossary (Ref 6.1). \n\nSAP  EDF.14  addresses  deterministic  consideration  of  CCFs  and  discusses  the \ndeterministic  expectation  for  modelling  of  CCFs.  Probabilistic  modelling  of  CCFs  is \nexpected  to  be  on  a  best-estimate  basis  and  any  claims  on  CCF  in  a  PSA  model \nshould  be  credible  and  adequately  justified,  however  additional  regulatory  scrutiny \nshould  be  applied  for  CCFs  below  1E-5.  PSA  studies  should  identify  the  relative \ncontribution  to  risk  from  the  features  of  the  facility  and  allow  a  judgement  on  the \nbalance  of  the  design.  This  is  ideally  achieved  if  each  component  of  the  study  is \ntreated  in  a  best  estimate  manner.  If  one  element  of  the  study  contains  a  large \nmeasure  of  conservatism  and  dominates  the  resulting  risk  calculation,  evaluating  the \nbenefit from improving the reliability of that element, or indeed other elements, is more \ndifficult. \n\nTherefore, while the use of conservative design basis analysis within the PSA can be \njustified to show either that the risks are low, or to act as a screening mechanism for \nfuture  best  estimate  analysis,  risk-informed  decision  making  could  be  severely \ncompromised by the use of this type of analysis.  \n\n3)  PSA Data \n\nFacility specific data should be used, to the extent possible, for the calculation of the \nfrequencies and probabilities used in PSA.  \n\nWhere  facility  specific  data  is  not  available,  use  of  generic  data  may  be  acceptable \nproviding  it  is  shown  to  be  appropriate  to  the  design  and  operating  conditions  of  the \nfacility and it relates to a relevant and sufficiently large population. The source of the \ndata, the sample size and the uncertainty in the data should be specified. If changes to \nthe  source  data  are  made  to  take  account  of  differences  between  the  available  data \nand the plant conditions, these should be justified. \n\nWhere  facility  specific  data  is  not  sufficient  it  should  be  combined  with  applicable \ngeneric  data  using  a  justified  mathematical  technique,  such  as  Bayesian  update  of \ngeneric data with facility-specific data (as described, for example, in Refs 6.2 and 6.3). \n\nWhere no relevant statistical data are available, judgements should be made and their \nbases  stated.  Particular  attention  should  be  paid  to  determining  the  sensitivity  of  the \nresults of the PSA to such judgements. Ad-hoc judgements not following a robust and \nsystematic process should generally attract inspector\u2019s scrutiny.     \n\nReport : NS-TAST-GD-030 \nCM9 Ref: 2018/408246 \n\nPage 6 of 81 \n\n \n \n\n\fOffice for Nuclear Regulation  \n \n \n\nWhen  models  are  used  for  the  calculations  of  probabilities  in  the  PSA,  the \nmethodologies used should be justified and should account for all the key influencing \nfactors. In particular: \n\ni.  Probability data for personnel errors should take account of the specific task \ndemands, psychological influences (e.g. stress), degree of supervision, level of \ntraining,  working  practices,  time  available,  physical  environment,  etc,  and  the \npotential  dependencies  between  separate  activities  (either  by  the  same  or  by \ndifferent  operators).  Any  equipment  or  procedural  requirements  to  promote \nreliable human performance should be identified. The best estimate approach \nto  risk  analysis  requires  that  the  beneficial  and  potentially  detrimental \nperformance of personnel be represented within the PSA. The factors that can \ninfluence  the  ability  of  personnel  to  carry  out  activities  need  to  be  carefully \nconsidered  before  any  quantification  can  take  place.  NS-TAST-GD-063  (Ref \n7.3)  discusses  the  subject  of  Task  Analysis  which  is  judged  a  necessary \nprecursor to any quantification. \n\nii. The approach selected for the Common Cause Failure (CCF) modelling and \nfor  CCF  parameter  estimation  should  be  justified  and  should  be  adequate  to \nrepresent any level of redundancy present in the specific design of the facility. \nThe  consideration  of  coupling  mechanisms  and  facility  specific  defences \nagainst  CCF  should  be  traceable.  The  applicability  of  the  CCF  data  sources \nused should be demonstrated. \n\niii.  The  methodology  used  for  the  calculation  of  probabilities  of  structural \nfailures should be justified and the details of the analysis should be transparent. \nIf  use  is  made  of  data  from  available  structural  (e.g.  pipework)  failure \ndatabases, the sources of data and the way in which the data has been used \nshould  be  clear  and  the  applicability  of  the  data  should  be  justified.  If  use  is \nmade  of  probabilistic  fracture  mechanics  codes,  the  codes  should  be  state  of \nthe art and should have been validated against operational experience and/or \nexperiments. The range of loads and combinations of loads that could lead to \nthe  structural  failures  of  concern  should  be  adequate  to  represent  the \nconditions which are possible for the facility under evaluation.   \n\niv.  Any  methodologies  used  by  licensees  to  estimate  computer  or  software-\nbased  system  reliability  for  use  in  PSA  are  expected  to  use  best-estimate \nmethods  and  to  consider  uncertainty  and  sensitivity.  These  methodologies \nshould meet industry accepted practices and consider the contributions of both \nhardware  and  software  failures.  Estimation  of  software  reliability  should  take \ninto  account  influencing  factors  (primarily  systematic)  that  affect  the  quality  of \nthe  software  and  are  informed  by  the  specification  and  design  of  the  system \n(e.g.  considering  the  reliability  targets  for  system  design  based  on  safety \nintegrity  levels  in  IEC  61508  or  equivalent).  Any  dependencies  introduced  by \nthe systematic nature of software failure(s) should be accounted for accordingly \nin  the  PSA.  If  software  elements  of  a  computer  based  system  (e.g.  operating \nsystems,  application  software  supporting  different  functions)  have  been \nindividually modelled in the PSA, the dependencies between the various parts \nshould be addressed explicitly. Any self-checking or diagnostic functions built in \nthe  computer  based  system  should  be  taken  into  account  in  an  adequate \nmanner  (e.g.  considering  the  dependencies  between  these  functions  and  the \nprimary safety functions delivered by the system). The dependencies between \ntwo  (or  more)  computer  based  systems  should  be  dealt  with  explicitly.  NS-\nTAST-GD-046 (Ref 7.8) and IAEA report NP-T-3.27 (Ref 8.4) provide additional \nguidance on the assessment of reliability for a computer based system. \n\nv. Assumptions on reliability of passive features or passive systems should be \nsubstantiated by suitable analysis covering the full range of accident conditions \nfor which they are required and by extensive tests.  \n\nReport : NS-TAST-GD-030 \nCM9 Ref: 2018/408246 \n\nPage 7 of 81 \n\n \n \n\n\fOffice for Nuclear Regulation  \n \n \n\nvi.  Analyses  to  estimate  the  probability  of  occurrence  of  phenomena  (for \nexample  in  the  severe  accident  portion  of  the  PSA)  should be  performed  in  a \nsystematic  and  transparent  manner  taking  account  of  up-to-date  information \nfrom an appropriate range of sources about the phenomena.  \n\n4)  PSA Results \n\nThe  results  of  the  PSA  should  be  comprehensively  documented  and  properly \ninterpreted.  The  numerical  results  of  the  PSA  should  always  be  presented  together \nwith  list/s  of  minimal  cutsets  and  the  list  of  basic  events  and  associated  importance \nmeasures  (as  a  minimum  Fractional  Contributions  or  Fussell  Vesely  Importance  and \nRisk  Increase  factors  or  Risk  Achievement  Worth).  It  should  be  noted  that  the \nimportance measures, in themselves, represent sensitivities of the results of the PSA \nto the inputs and, therefore, the dutyholders should provide justification of whether any \nhigh  values  shown  are  acceptable  and  nothing  reasonable  can  be  done  to  reduce \nunduly high risk contributions.  \n\nIn all aspects of the analysis where assumptions have been made including those on \nhow  the  plant  and  the  operating  staff  behave,  these  and  their  justification  should  be \nclearly described. The sensitivity of the results of the PSA to changes in assumptions \nshould be evaluated and clearly documented.  \n\nUncertainty  on  input  probability  and  frequency  values  should  be  estimated  and \npropagated  through  the  models  to  generate  uncertainty  distributions  on  the  resulting \nfrequencies  or  probabilities  of  undesired  events.  The  means  of  these  distributions \nshould be compared against the numerical targets in the SAPs.  \n\nBased  on  the  importance,  sensitivity  and  uncertainty  evaluations,  the  dutyholder \nshould  gain  an  understanding  of  which  parametric  and  modelling  uncertainties \ncontribute  most  to  the  overall  uncertainty  in  the  probabilities  or  frequencies  of \nundesired events and should, subject to reasonable practicability, take steps to reduce \nsuch uncertainties.  \n\nUltimately,  the  results  of  the  uncertainty  and  sensitivity  evaluations  should  provide \nconfidence that the overall conclusions obtained from the PSA are still valid. \n\n\u201cPSA  should  be  used  to  inform  the  design  process  and  help  ensure  the  safe \noperation of the site and its facilities\u201d \n\nThe aim of this principle is to establish the expectations on what uses the dutyholders \nshould  make  of  the  PSA  to  support  decision-making  and  on  how  the  supporting \nanalyses should be undertaken. \n\n1)  Uses of PSA  \n\nThe  PSA  should  provide  information  for,  and  receive  information  from,  the  facility \ndesigners  and  operators  so  that  consistency  is  achieved  between  the  PSA  and  the \ndesign and operation of the facility. Following such an approach allows the PSA to be \na powerful tool to aid decision making. Inspectors should expect the PSA to provide an \ninput to the following: \n\ni.  Initial  design,  design  development  and  design  modifications  and  back-fits \nduring  the  life  of  the  facility.  ONR  expects  the  PSA  to  be  integrated  into  the \ndesign  process  in  an  iterative  manner,  i.e.  the  PSA  should  be  used  in  all  the \nstages of the design. \n\nii.  Support  to  the  safety  classification  of  structures,  systems  and  components \n(SSCs). ONR expects PSA to inform the safety classification of SSCs through \nconsideration  of \nimportance \nmeasures.  \n\nfor  example  system  reliabilities  and  PSA \n\n4.7 \n\nFault analysis: PSA \u2013 Use of PSA \u2013 FA.14 \n\nReport : NS-TAST-GD-030 \nCM9 Ref: 2018/408246 \n\nPage 8 of 81 \n\n \n \n\n\fOffice for Nuclear Regulation  \n \n \n\niii. Development of, and changes to, operating limits and conditions and testing, \ninspection and maintenance schedules of the facility. \n\niv.  Testing,  inspection  and  maintenance  planning  and  daily  management  of \nplant configuration.  \n\nv. Periodic system reviews and overall periodic safety review of the facility.  \n\nvi. Justification for any change to the way in which the facility is operated.  \n\nvii.  Development  of,  and  changes  to,  operating  procedures  for  managing  all \nstages of incidents and accidents, including severe accidents. \n\nviii. Design of, and changes to, operator-training programmes for management \nof incidents and accidents, including severe accidents. \n\nix. Off-site emergency planning and response including a demonstration of the \neffectiveness of countermeasures. \n\nx. Evaluation of the risk significance of the abnormal occurrences at the facility \nand identification of measures to avoid future recurrences of safety significant \nevents. \n\nIn  addition  to  the  above,  PSA  can  and  should  provide  valuable  information  to \nONR inspectors in the following (see Ref 6.6): \n\na.  Understanding  the  safety  significance  of  the  issues  under  consideration  by \nthe Office for Nuclear Regulation, e.g. modifications being assessed or events \nunder investigation.  \n\nb.  Focusing  inspection  activities  on  those  areas  (systems,  components, \nfeatures, etc.) with the highest safety significance. \n\nc. Understanding the safety significance of inspection findings.  \n\nd.  Assisting  in  forming  a  judgement  towards  the  adequacy  of  licensees\u2019 \ndemonstration of meeting SAP Numerical Targets 5 and 6. \n\n2)  Technical adequacy of PSA applications  \n\nFor  the  PSA  to  be  an  effective  tool  to  support  decision  making,  not  only  should  the \nquality of the PSA be adequate (in line with SAP FA.13) but also the way in which the \nPSA is used should be appropriate, i.e. PSA studies performed to support any safety \nsubmission, including the justification of any modification to plant or operation, should \nbe comprehensive, technically sound and properly documented. In this regard: \n\ni.  Any issue that is going to be evaluated using PSA (e.g. a facility design or \noperational feature, a proposed change to the design, or an event at the facility) \nshould be explicitly defined together with the type of results required as input to \nthe decision-making, including any numerical criteria that need to be met.  \n\nii. All aspects of the PSA model and data potentially affected by the issue under \nstudy should be identified, evaluated for impact and modified if necessary. \n\niii.  All  the  assumptions  should  be  checked  for  validity  against  the  issue  under \nstudy and modified if appropriate. \n\niv.  Sensitivity analyses should be carried out to estimate the sensitivity of the \nrisk to changes in relevant assumptions and areas of modelling uncertainty, to \ncheck the risk impact of different options under consideration and to carry out \n\u2018what  if\u2019  analyses  if  appropriate.  The  results  of  the  sensitivity  analyses  should \nbe used to inform the decision-making process.   \n\nv. Uncertainty analyses should be carried out  \n\nvi.  Based  on  the  results  of  the  sensitivity  and  uncertainty  analyses,  the \ndutyholder  should  show  that  the  most  important  modelling  and  parametric \n\nReport : NS-TAST-GD-030 \nCM9 Ref: 2018/408246 \n\nPage 9 of 81 \n\n \n \n\n\fOffice for Nuclear Regulation  \n \n \n\nuncertainties have been minimised, or that the results of the application are not \naffected by these uncertainties, or that the decision based on the results of the \napplication  takes  account  of  the  uncertainties  by  adopting  the  precautionary \nprinciple (as described  in paragraphs 89 and the following  ones of R2P2,  Ref \n6.5). \n\nvii.  The  issue  under  study  could  potentially  affect  aspects  of  the  risk  not \ncovered  within  the  scope  of  the existing  PSA.  These limitations  in  the  PSA  in \nrelation  to  the  issue  under  evaluation  should  be  recognised  and  identified \nexplicitly.  In  order  to  perform  a  comprehensive  risk  analysis  the  PSA  models \nshould be extended and/or enhanced to cover the missing aspects. If this is not \npracticable  (e.g.  due  to  time  constraints),  the  risk  impact  of  the  issue \nassociated  with  areas  outside  the  scope  of  the  existing  PSA  should  be \nanalysed qualitatively.   \n\nviii.  The  outcome  of  the  PSA  studies  performed  to  evaluate  issues  should  be \nclear,  comprehensive  and  traceable  and  should  provide  recommendations \nbased  on  a  systematic  application  of  decision-making  criteria  applied  to  the \nresults of the PSA evaluations.  \n\n4.8 \n\nFault analysis: assurance of validity of data and models \u2013 Theoretical models \u2013 AV.1 \n\n\u201cTheoretical models should adequately represent the facility and site\u201d \n\nTheoretical  models  are  used  throughout  the  PSA,  e.g.,  reliability  models  (including \nCCF and human reliability models), models for the evaluation of the thermal-hydraulic \nor  chemical  behaviour,  the  progression  of  the  accident  and  the  transport  of  fission \nproducts,  models  for  the  analysis  of  structural  integrity  of  containment  and  any  other \nstructures,  models  for  the  evaluation  of  the  impact  of  the  various  isotopes  on  human \nhealth, etc.  \n\nSAP AV.1 is strongly linked to AV.2 discussed below and together aim to ensure that \nall the calculations that underlay the PSA are adequate to represent the facility. In this \nrespect, these SAPs reinforce specific PSA SAPs FA.11 and FA.13 above.  \n\n4.9 \n\nFault analysis: assurance of validity of data and models \u2013 Calculation methods \u2013 AV.2 \n\n\u201cCalculation  methods  used  for  the  analyses  should  adequately  represent  the \nphysical and chemical processes taking place\u201d \n\nCalculation  methods  are  used  in  support  of  various  tasks  in  PSA,  e.g.  thermal-\nhydraulic  analyses,  analyses  of  chemical  behaviour,  accident  progression  analyses, \nanalysis of structural integrity of containment and any other structures, fission product \nrelease  and  transport,  analysis  of  health  effects,  etc.  PSA  software,  in  itself,  uses  a \ncalculation algorithm to quantify the PSA models and to obtain the list of cutsets. The \naim  of  this  principle  is  to  ensure  that  all  the  calculation  methods  used  in  the  PSA \nadequately  represent  the  real  processes  taking  place  in  the  facility  and  that  the \ncalculations are done as intended by the analysts.  \n\nFor  this,  inspectors  should  satisfy  themselves  that  the  calculation  algorithms  have \nbeen validated with actual experience, experiments, tests or other calculation methods. \nInspectors  should  also  seek  evidence  that  uncertainties  in  the  calculation  methods \nused  have  been  recognised  by  the  dutyholder  and  that  methods  have  only  been \napplied within their limit of applicability. As deemed appropriate, inspectors may wish to \nconsider undertaking (or commissioning) independent calculations for some aspects of \nthe  PSA  (e.g.,  addressing  areas  of  particular  concern)  using  different  calculation \nmethods.  This  is  particularly  important  if  the  PSA  is  being  used  to  support  a  new \ndesign. TAG NS-TAST-GD-042 (Ref 7.7) should be referred to for further guidance. \n\n4.10  Fault analysis: assurance of validity of data and models \u2013 Use of data \u2013 AV.3 \n\nReport : NS-TAST-GD-030 \nCM9 Ref: 2018/408246 \n\nPage 10 of 81 \n\n \n \n\n\fOffice for Nuclear Regulation  \n \n \n\n\u201cThe  data  used  in  the  analysis  of  aspects  of  plant  performance  with  safety \nsignificance should be shown to be valid for the circumstances by reference to \nestablished physical data, experiment or other appropriate means\u201d \n\nFailure rate and probability data is the basis of the PSA; therefore, for the PSA to be an \nadequate  representation  of  the  facility,  it  should  make  use  of  data  that  can  be \ndemonstrated to be valid for the facility. The use of data in PSA has been discussed in \nSection  4.6  (3)  above.  Section  4.6  (4)  has  also  discussed  the  need  to  evaluate  the \nuncertainty in the input data and its impact on the overall PSA results. Section 4.7 (2) \nhas  addressed  how  to  interpret  this  uncertainty  in  decision-making.  Therefore,  this \nSAP is viewed as a reinforcement of specific PSA SAPs FA.13 and FA.14.  \n\nData  about  physical  processes  is also an  input  to  PSA supporting  calculations.  Such \ndata should be justified by reference to physical data, experiment or other appropriate \nmeans. See also 4.11. \n\n4.11  Fault analysis: assurance of validity of data and models \u2013 Computer models \u2013 AV.4 \n\n\u201cComputer  models  and  datasets  used  in  support  of  the  safety  analysis  should \nbe  developed,  maintained  and  applied  in  accordance  with  quality  management \nprocedures\u201d \n\nComputer models are developed to support various tasks in PSA, e.g. for derivation of \nsuccess criteria, accident progression analyses, fission product release and transport, \nanalysis  of  structural  integrity  of  containment  and  any  other  structures,  etc.  The  PSA \nitself  comprises  a  computer  model  and  an  associated  database.  Therefore,  the \nrelevance of this SAP cannot be stressed enough. The aim of this principle is to ensure \nthat  all  the  calculations  that  underlay  the  PSA  are  undertaken  without  error.  For  this, \ninspectors  may  wish  to  satisfy  themselves  that  the  dutyholders  have  put  in  place \nadequate procedures to develop, maintain and apply computer models and databases.  \n\nThese  procedures  should  cover  verification,  validation  or  qualification  of  computer \ncodes,  as  appropriate,  for  the  specific  design  of  the  facility.  The  procedures  should \nalso  require  the  dutyholder  to  identify  the  degree  of  accuracy  and  uncertainties \nassociated  with  the  selected  computer  codes  and  to  ensure  that  the  codes  are  only \nused within their limit of applicability and by adequately trained users. In addition, the \nprocedures  should  require  the  dutyholder  to  ensure  that  the  modelling  of  the  plant \ninputted as underlying basis for the calculations and the input data files are auditable \nand  are  verified.  Inspectors  may  choose  to  review  or  audit  these  procedures  and/or \nseek evidence of their correct application by the dutyholder. \n\nGenerally inspectors should expect that the Quality Assurance process applied to the \nPSA covers all items identified in SAP AV.4.  Further guidance on the use of computer \nmodels in safety cases is provided in NS-TAST-GD-042 (Ref 7.7). \n\n4.12  Fault analysis: assurance of validity of data and models \u2013 Documentation \u2013 AV.5 \n\n\u201cDocumentation  should  be  provided  to  facilitate  review  of  the  adequacy  of  the \nanalytical models and data\u201d \n\nPSAs  are  generally  large  and  complex  safety  analyses.  Therefore,  for  them  to  be \ntraceable, reproducible, verifiable and updatable, they need to be documented in such \na  way  as  to  ensure  that  each  aspect  of  the  PSA  can  be  directly  related  to  existing \nfacility information, facility documentation or the analysts\u2019 assumptions in the absence \nof  such  information.  In  this  respect  this  SAP  reinforces  PSA-specific  SAP  FA.11 \n(Validity) addressed above. \n\nGood practice on PSA documentation can be found in IAEA TECDOC on Living PSA \n(Ref 6.4). This report recommends that, as part of the PSA documentation, individual \nTask  Procedures  should  be  developed  to  ensure  that  all  analysts  working  on  a  task \ndevelop  a  consistent  set  of  models  which  interface  without  overlap  or  omission. \n\nReport : NS-TAST-GD-030 \nCM9 Ref: 2018/408246 \n\nPage 11 of 81 \n\n \n \n\n\fOffice for Nuclear Regulation  \n \n \n\nInspectors  may  choose  to  review  or  audit  these  procedures,  if  available,  to  gain \nconfidence on the consistent application of methods throughout the PSA.  \n\nRef  6.4  also  recommends  that  for  each  PSA  task,  analysis  files  should  be  compiled \nincluding  relevant  reports,  input  data,  relevant  calculations,  and  model  or  database \nfiles  containing  task  results.  The  PSA  task  reports:  should  describe  the  analyses \nperformed  and  all  the  modelling  assumptions;  should  identify  interfaces  with  other \ntasks; and should list all the references used. These analysis files should be controlled \ndocuments  which  are  maintained  for  the  life  of  the  facility.  They  enable  any  PSA \nanalyst familiar with the particular task to recreate, modify or review the particular part \nof the PSA. Experience with large PSA models suggest that unless there is a complete \nset  of  such  files,  it  is  very  difficult  to  define  and  understand  each  element  of  the \ncomputer model and the results of its quantification. \n\n4.13  Fault analysis: assurance of validity of data and models \u2013 Sensitivity analyses \u2013 AV.6 \n\n\u201cStudies should be carried out to determine the sensitivity of the analysis (and \nthe conclusions drawn from it) to the assumptions made, the data used and the \nmethods of calculation\u201d  \n\nSensitivity analyses are a key aspect of the PSA because they are needed to provide \nconfidence  that  the  conclusions  obtained  from  the  PSA  are  valid  despite  the \nuncertainties  associated  with  the  supporting  analysis  and  assumptions  used  in  the \ndevelopment of the PSA. If the sensitivity analyses performed do not provide sufficient \nconfidence in the validity of the conclusions of the PSA, reasonably practicable steps \nneed to be taken to reduce the uncertainties associated with the model and data \u2013 this \nmay include use of independent methods and computer codes, where appropriate, as \nindicated in the text accompanying SAP AV.6.  \n\nSensitivity  analyses  have  been  addressed  in  Section  4.6  (4).  In  addition,  Section  4.7 \n(2)  discusses  the  role  of  sensitivity  analyses  when  using  PSA  to  support  decision-\nmaking. Therefore, this SAP reinforces specific PSA SAPs FA.13 and FA.14.  \n\n4.14  Fault analysis: assurance of validity of data and models \u2013 Data collection \u2013 AV.7 \n\n\u201cData should be collected throughout the operating life of the facility to check or \nupdate the safety analysis\u201d \n\nThe  validity  and  applicability  of  the  IE  frequencies,  component  failure  probabilities, \nunavailabilities,  etc,  used  in  the  PSA  can  only  be  assured  if  these  are  reviewed \nperiodically using facility specific information.  \n\nTherefore, it is reasonable to expect dutyholders to put systems in place for collecting \nrelevant data throughout the life of the facility and to use this data every time the PSA \nis updated as required e.g. by PSA SAP FA.11 (above) and Assurance of Validity SAP \nAV.8 (below). \n\n4.15  Fault analysis: assurance of validity of data and models \u2013 Update and review \u2013 AV.8 \n\n\u201cThe  safety  analysis  should  be  updated  where  necessary  and  reviewed \nperiodically\u201d \n\nLicence Condition 15 requires the licensees to conduct periodic reviews of the safety \ncases for their facilities. These periodic safety reviews (PSRs) are normally carried out \nevery ten years. However a licensee's arrangements under LC15 should also require \ninterim  reviews  on  a  shorter  term  basis  taking  into  account  the  number  and  safety \nsignificance of modifications to the facility and/or changes to the safety case since the \nprevious review (See NS-TAST-GD-050, Ref 7.9).  \n\nAV.8 should also be interpreted as highlighting the principle of Living PSA, in that ONR \nexpects  PSAs  to  be  living  analyses  that  constantly  reflect  the  best  estimate  of  the \ndutyholder on the reliability of components, plant availability etc, current knowledge on \n\nReport : NS-TAST-GD-030 \nCM9 Ref: 2018/408246 \n\nPage 12 of 81 \n\n \n \n\n\fOffice for Nuclear Regulation  \n \n \n\nplant behaviour, and modern analysis methods. In this regard, this principle reinforces \nthe specific PSA principle FA.11 discussed above.  \n\nIt  is  expected  that  review  by  the  facility  operators  will  identify  if  operating  experience \nhas proved to be significantly different from the assumptions in the analyses and then \ntake action to ensure that risks remain ALARP. \n\nThe  frequency  at  which  an  updating  or  reconsideration  of  the  PSA  should  be  carried \nout will depend upon a number of factors, e.g. related to the systems that are in place \nto  collect  and  analyse  data  and  to  the  understanding  of  ageing  effect  and  trends  in \nsystem  reliability.  Dutyholders  are  expected  to  evaluate  the  impact  of  modifications \n(design,  procedures,  operating  practices,  etc.)  on  the  PSA  results  on  a case-by-case \nbasis. Some modifications may therefore require the PSA to be immediately updated. \nIAEA TECDOC on Living PSA (Ref 6.4) indicates that it is a good practice at operating \nNPPs not to accumulate a backlog of such evaluations for a period longer than a year. \nIt  also  suggests  that,  even  if  risk-significant  modifications  do  not  arise  for  a  longer \nperiod,  the  dutyholder  should  still  revise,  update  and  formally  amend  the  PSA  every \nthree years.  \n\n4.16  Target 7: Individual risk to people off the site from accidents \n\n\u201cThe targets for the individual risk of death to a person off the site, from \naccidents at the site resulting in exposure to ionising radiation, are: \n\nBSL:  1 x 10-4 pa \n\nBSO:  1 x 10-6 pa\u201d \n\nTarget 7 address accident risks to the public, summed for all facilities on a site. \n\n4.17  Target 8: Frequency dose targets for accidents on an individual facility \u2013 any person off \n\nthe site \n\n\u201cThe targets for the total predicted frequencies of accidents on an individual \nfacility, which could give doses to a person off the site are: \n\nEffective dose, mSv  \n\nTotal predicted frequency per annum \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n0.1-1 \n\n1-10 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n10-100  \n\n100-1000 \n\n>1000   \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nBSL \n\n1 \n\n \n\n \n\nBSO \n\n1 x 10-2 \n\n1 x 10-1 \n\n1 x 10-3 \n\n1 x 10-2  \n\n1 x 10-4 \n\n1 x 10-3 \n\n1 x 10-5 \n\n1 x 10-4 \n\n1 x 10-6\u201d \n\nTarget 8 sets limits on the frequencies of classes of accidents at individual facilities \nthat could give rise to doses off the site within the specified bands. \n\n4.18  Target 9: Total risk of 100 or more fatalities \n\n\u201cThe targets for the total risk of 100 or more fatalities, either immediate or \neventual, from accidents at the site in exposure to ionising radiation, are: \n\nBSL: \n\n \n\nBSO:   \n\n1 x 10-5 pa \n\n1 x 10-7 pa\u201d \n\n \n \n\nReport : NS-TAST-GD-030 \nCM9 Ref: 2018/408246 \n\nPage 13 of 81 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fOffice for Nuclear Regulation  \n \n \n\nTarget 9 is intended to be used as a guide to assist in judging whether more detailed \nanalysis is warranted.

Issue O of this document refers to Probabilistic Safety Analysis (PSA). This TAG \nis  consistent  with  Issue  O  of  the  WENRA  reference  levels.  Appendix  2  presents  the \nmapping between Issue O of the WENRA reference levels and this TAG. \n\n4.20  Relationship with the IAEA Standards \n\nKey relevant IAEA publications on PSA are listed in Sections 6, 8, A1-4 and A1-5. The \ncontents of this TAG, including its Appendix 1, are broadly consistent with those IAEA \npublications. In particular, Refs [6.4, A1-5.6 and A1-5.10] and the IAEA Specific Safety \nGuides on Level 1 and Level 2 PSA, Refs [A1-5.7 and A1-5.8] have been specifically \nused for the preparation of Appendix 1 of the TAG. \n\n5. \n\nADVICE TO INSPECTORS \n\n5.1 \n\nIntroduction \n\nThis section of the TAG aims to provide guidance on the assessment of a PSA which \ngenerally  is  associated  with  SAPs  FA.10  to  FA.14.  The  guidance  in  this  section  is \npresented in the order of a typical PSA as this is likely to be of more practical value to \nthe inspectors.  \n\nThis section is split up into a number of parts dealing with the different elements of a \nPSA.  Each  part  is  made  up  of  a  number  of  specific  points  of  guidance  to  ONR \ninspectors. It should be noted that all of these points need not be met fully in each and \nevery instance. It is left to the judgement of the individual inspector to identify both the \nscope of assessment and which, if any, of the shortfalls are significant. \n\nThe  guidance  provided  in  this  section  is  generally  applicable  to  the  assessment  of \nPSAs  for  all  types  of  nuclear  facilities.  However,  more  specific  and  detailed \nassessment expectations for review of PSAs for NPPs are given in Appendix 1 to this \nTAG. Since much of the guidance provided in Appendix 1 can also be applied to other \ntypes  of  facilities,  inspectors  may  wish  to  use  Appendix  1  at  their  discretion  for  the \nassessment of PSAs for facilities other than NPPs. \n\n1)  PSA should be a systematic analysis to identify all important fault sequences which \ncan lead to radiological consequences and to evaluate their contribution to the level of \nrisk  represented  by  the  facility.  The  PSA  should  set  out  to  identify  all  the  significant \ncontributions to the estimate of the level of risk otherwise the analysis is not complete \nand conclusions drawn from the analysis may thus be incorrect. \n\n2)  The same expectation of scope for PSAs is, in principle, applicable to both old and \nnew facilities. However, the methods and details of analysis that licensees choose to \nuse to demonstrate that the level of risk from their facility is ALARP may be different. \n\n3)  The inspector may consider: \n\ni.  in  cases  where  there  is  currently  no  PSA,  whether  producing  one  would  be \nworthwhile; \n\n5.2 \n\nPSA Scope \n\nReport : NS-TAST-GD-030 \nCM9 Ref: 2018/408246 \n\nPage 14 of 81 \n\n \n \n\n\fOffice for Nuclear Regulation  \n \n \n\nii.  in  cases  where  there  is  a  PSA,  whether  the  objectives  of  the  analysis  are \nappropriate and its scope adequate to meet them; \n\niii. whether the scope of the PSA covers all the sources of radioactivity on the \nfacility; \n\niv. whether the scope of the PSA allows a meaningful comparison to be made \nwith the numerical targets of the SAPs; \n\nv. whether the scope of the PSA covers all classes of IEs and hazards; \n\nvi. whether the scope of the PSA covers all foreseeable operating modes of the \nfacility; \n\nvii.  whether  any  reductions  in  scope  of  the  PSA  from  the  above  pointers  are \nidentified; \n\nviii.  whether,  where  the  scope  of  the  PSA  has  been  reduced,  a  justification  is \nprovided to confirm that this would not change the conclusions of the PSA; \n\nix.   in the case of a site with multiple reactors or facilities, whether the scope of \nthe PSA is well defined (e.g. for a single representative unit, or multiple units or \nfacilities),  and  whether  the  justification  for  scope  is  provided  and  adequate \n(additional discussion on multi-unit considerations is contained in Section 5.13). \n\n4)  Specific assessment expectations for review of the scope of the PSA for NPPs can \nbe found in Table A1-1.2 (PSA Scope) of Appendix 1. \n\n5.3 \n\nPSA Methodology \n\n1)  The starting point for the PSA is a detailed description of the design and operation \nof  the  facility  and  its  associated  protection  system,  and  their  behaviour  in  fault \nconditions. This would typically include facility descriptions, fault schedules, drawings, \noperating  instructions,  safety  reports  and  transient,  radiological  and  any  other \ndeterministic analyses that support the PSA. \n\n2)  The inspector may consider whether: \n\ni. the detailed design of the facility and its equipment to which the PSA refers is \nidentified; \n\nii.  sufficient  information  is  provided  on  the  design  and  operation  of  the  facility \nand  on  its  behaviour  in  fault  conditions  to  support  the  PSA.  (The  inspector \nshould consider carrying out a site visit(s) to confirm a selection of design and \noperating assumptions used in the PSA); \n\niii.  the  methods  of  analysis  used  in  the  PSA  are  defined  and  are  suitable  to \nmeet the objectives of the analysis; \n\niv. the PSA has been fully documented; \n\nv. the PSA has been carried out in accordance with written QA procedures; \n\nvi.  the  PSA  has  undergone  an  independent  assessment/peer  review  and  the \nfindings are acceptable. \n\n3)  Specific assessment expectations for review of the adequacy of the documentation \nprovided in support of each technical task of the PSAs for NPPs can be found in the \nvarious Tables of Appendix 1. \n\n5.4 \n\nDerivation of Initiating Events Including Hazards \n\n1)   A list should be included providing identification of all of the identifiable IEs within \nthe scope of the PSA which could lead directly or in combination with other failures to a \nrelease of radioactive material. \n\n2)  The inspector may consider whether: \n\n \n \n\nReport : NS-TAST-GD-030 \nCM9 Ref: 2018/408246 \n\nPage 15 of 81 \n\n\fOffice for Nuclear Regulation  \n \n \n\ni. the list of IEs covers all the sources of radioactive material in the facility; \n\nii.  the  quantity,  form  and  location  of  all  radioactive  material  in  the  facility  is \nidentified; \n\niii.  if  any  sources  of  radioactive  material  are  not  included  in  the  PSA, \njustification is given that this would not lead to a significant contribution to the \nrisk; \n\niv. the list of IEs covers all the operating modes of the facility; \n\nv.  if  any  operating  mode  is  not  covered  in  the  list  of  IEs,  justification  is  given \nthat the contribution to the risk is small during this operating mode; \n\nvi.  the  IE  identification  process  is  shown  to  be  comprehensive  so  that  all \npossible IEs are identified; \n\nvii. the list of IEs includes partial failures as well as total failure; \n\nviii. all relevant internal hazards are listed; \n\nix. all relevant external hazards are listed; \n\nx. each IE  is defined; \n\nxi. the causes of each IE are identified; \n\nxii.  features  such  as  administrative  systems,  control  systems,  interlocks  etc. \nwhich limit the frequency of an IE are identified; \n\nxiii. failures of protection system equipment which can occur as a consequence \nof an IE are identified; \n\nxiv. a list is prepared of IEs which are screened from the list of IEs because of \nvery low frequency or \"incredibility\", with reference to the justification; \n\nxv. full records of the IE identification process are available and are of suitable \nquality; \n\nxvi. any IE screening criteria adopted are clearly described and justified. \n\n3)  Specific assessment expectations for review of the adequacy and completeness of \nthe  list  of  IEs  considered  in  the  PSAs  for  NPPs  can  be  found  in  Tables  A1-2.1 \n(identification and grouping of  initiating events), A1-2.7 (analysis of hazards) and A1-\n2.8 (low power and shutdown modes) of Appendix 1. \n\n5.5 \n\nProtection and Mitigation Systems \n\n1)  The PSA should identify the safety systems which are required to operate for each \nof the IEs and identify the success criteria for each of the safety functions. \n\n2)  The inspector may consider whether for each IE:  \n\ni. the safety functions have been identified; \n\nii.  the  minimum  safety  systems  requirements  to  achieve  the  safety  functions \nhave been identified; \n\niii.  the  minimum  protection  system  requirements  are  consistent  with  any \ndeterministic / transient analysis presented; \n\niv. for automatic protection actions, the parameters and systems used to initiate \nthe action have been identified; \n\nv.    for  manually  initiated  protection  actions,  the  alarms  and  indications  which \nwould alert the operator to the need for the action are identified. \n\n3)    Specific  assessment  expectations  for  review  of  the  adequacy  of  the  credited \nsafeguards  in  PSAs  for  NPPs  can  be  found  in  Table  A1-2.2  (Accident  sequence \ndevelopment: determination of success criteria) of Appendix 1. \n\n \n \n\nReport : NS-TAST-GD-030 \nCM9 Ref: 2018/408246 \n\nPage 16 of 81 \n\n\fOffice for Nuclear Regulation  \n \n \n\n5.6 \n\nAccident Sequence Analysis \n\n1)    The  next  stage  of  the  PSA  is  the  accident  sequence  analysis  which  models  the \nbehaviour  of  the  facility  for  the  IEs.  The  analysis  should  cover  all  possible \ncombinations  of  success  or  failure  of  the  protection  systems  to  perform  the  safety \nfunctions and should identify the accident sequences which involve failure to maintain \nthe facility within safe limits. \n\n2)  The end points of the accident sequence analysis should be categorised in terms \ncompatible  with  the  numerical  targets  of  the  SAPs  addressed.  This  does  not \nnecessarily mean that the categories defined by the dutyholders have to be identical to \nthose  corresponding  to  the  numerical  targets  of  the  SAPs.  However,  safety  cases \nshould be presented in a manner which allows inspectors to make judgements against \nthe SAPs\u2019 targets. The inspector may check that, for each IE: \n\ni.  the  accident  sequence  analysis  covers  all  the  safety  functions  required  and \nall  the  combinations  of  protection  system  equipment  which  can  operate  to \nperform the safety functions; \n\nii.  the  accident  sequence  analysis  takes  account  of  all  the  functional \ndependencies between safety functions and protection systems; \n\niii. the accident sequence analysis covers all the mechanisms which could lead \nto  failure  of  the  physical  barriers  such  as  a  reactor  pressure  vessel  or  the \ncontainment; \n\niv. the accident sequence analysis covers the factors which  affect the release \nand  transport  of  radioactive  materials  to  the  environment  and  their  effects  on \nhumans; \n\nv. sufficient radiological analysis is available to justify the categorisation of the \nend-points  of \nthat  best-estimate \nassumptions have been made; \n\nthe  accident  sequence  analysis  or \n\nvi.  the  transient,  radiological  and  other  deterministic  analyses  used  to  support \nthe PSA models do not contain undue pessimisms (these should preferably be \nbest estimate); \n\nvii.  where  IEs  are  grouped,  the  frequency  is  the  sum  of  the  individual  IEs \ngrouped and the group is represented by the most onerous one. \n\n3)  Specific assessment expectations for review of the adequacy of the grouping of IEs \nin  PSAs  for  NPPs  can  be  found  in  Table  A1-2.1  of  Appendix  1.  Specific  assessment \nexpectations  for  review  of  the  accident  sequence  analysis  in  PSAs  for  NPPs  can  be \nfound in Table A1-2.3 of Appendix 1. \n\n5.7 \n\nProtection and Mitigation Systems Failure Analysis \n\n1)  The accident sequence analysis identifies combinations of IEs and failures of safety \nsystems  and  then  considers  the  failures  of  these  systems  down  to  a  lower  level  to \nidentify the combinations of basic events within the various safety systems or support \nsystems  which  could  lead  to  the  failure.  The  basic  events  would  typically  include; \ncomponent  failure,  CCF,  component  unavailability  during  maintenance  or  test  and \noperator error. \n\n2)    The  most  usual  method  of  safety  system  analysis  is  fault  tree  analysis;  other \ntechniques are acceptable but may need additional scrutiny. \n\n3)  The inspector may consider whether: \n\ni.  the  systems  failure  analysis  covers  all  the  failure  states  identified  by  the \naccident sequence analysis; \n\nReport : NS-TAST-GD-030 \nCM9 Ref: 2018/408246 \n\nPage 17 of 81 \n\n \n \n\n\fOffice for Nuclear Regulation  \n \n \n\nii.  the  analysis  has  been  carried  out  to  a  low  enough  level  of  detail  (e.g. \nindividual  component  level)  so  that  the  design  and  operation  of  the  system  is \nadequately modelled; \n\niii.  all  the  relevant  failure  modes  of  protection  system  equipment  have  been \nincluded; \n\niv.  where  components  have  been  grouped  together  in  the  analysis  (e.g.  in \n\u201csuper-components\u201d), failure of each of the components in the mode specified \nhas the same effect on the system and justification is clearly documented; \n\nv. the systems failure analysis models all the support systems required and that \nall interdependencies due to common services have been represented; \n\nvi.  the  systems  failure  analysis  takes  account  of  consequential  failures  which \ncould occur due to the IE or hazard; \n\nvii.  CCFs  are  included  in  the  models  at  an  appropriate  level  and  that  the \nprobability given to each CCF has been derived on a best-estimate basis;   \n\nviii. all operator errors which can contribute to the failure of a system credited in \nthe  PSA  have  been  identified  and  modelled  in  the  analysis,  with  due \nconsideration of dependencies; \n\nix. the unavailability of components, trains of systems or the entirety of systems \nduring periods of maintenance or testing has been addressed in the analysis. \n\n4)    Specific  assessment  expectations  for  review  of  the  System  Analysis  in  PSAs  for \nNPPs can be found in Table A1-2.4 of Appendix 1. \n\n5.8 \n\nPSA Input Data \n\n1)  Data is required to estimate the frequencies and probabilities in the PSA. \n\n2)  The inspector may consider whether: \n\ni.  data  is  provided  for  all  the  basic  events  and  IE  frequencies  included  in  the \nPSA; \n\nii.  the  data  provided  is  preferably  best  estimate  and  appropriate  for  the  use \nmade of it in the PSA; \n\niii.  where  use  is  made  of  operating  experience  data  in  calculating  IE \nfrequencies  and  component  failure  rates,  and  the  event  is  a  potentially \nimportant  contributor  to  the  risk,  there  is  an  adequate  discussion  of  the \nrelevance of the data and the statistical uncertainty; \n\niv.  where  insufficient  directly  relevant  data  are  available,  the  source  of  any \nquoted generic data and the basis of any judgements are stated; \n\nv. for IE frequencies: \n\na. the data covers all the causes of the IEs which have been identified; \n\nb. where the IE frequency has been calculated from failure data for the \ncauses  of  the  fault,  the  data  is  applicable  for  this  use  and  has  been \ncombined correctly to derive the frequency; \n\nc.  where  no  relevant  operating  data  is  available  and  judgement  has \nbeen used to assign the IE frequency, the basis for this judgement has \nbeen stated and shown to be valid, as far as possible; \n\nvi.  for component failure rates (or probabilities): \n\na. the boundaries of the component for which the data is specified are \ndefined; \n\nb. the data covers all relevant failure modes of the component; \n\nReport : NS-TAST-GD-030 \nCM9 Ref: 2018/408246 \n\nPage 18 of 81 \n\n \n \n\n\fOffice for Nuclear Regulation  \n \n \n\nc.  the  data  used  corresponds  to  the  component  in  terms  of  type, \nmanufacture, operating environment, usage and maintenance regime; \n\nd. the form of the data is suitable - that is, a failure rate per unit time or \na  failure  probability  per  demand  is  given  as  appropriate  for  running  or \nstandby components; \n\ne. where a test interval is used to change a failure rate per unit time to a \nfailure  probability  per  demand,  there  should  be  a  reference  to  the \nrelevant testing schedule and procedures; \n\nf.  where  a  component  is  required  to  operate  continuously  after  a  fault, \nthe required period of operation is defined and justified by reference to \nthe supporting deterministic analysis; \n\nvii. for component unavailabilities: \n\na. the data covers all causes of component unavailability including tests \n(scheduled  and  unscheduled),  maintenance \n(scheduled  and \nunscheduled) and repair; \n\nb. justification is given that the frequency and duration of the component \nunavailabilities adequately represents typical facility operation; \n\nviii.  for CCFs: \n\na.  the probability of failure associated with each CCF is derived using \nbest-estimate methods; \n\nb.  where numerical values are derived through engineering judgement, \nadequate justification is given that this reflects the potential for common \ncause failures to occur. The engineering judgement should take account \nof  layout,  segregation  and  any  other  measures  adopted  to  reduce  the \nlikelihood of a common cause failure (see NS-TAST-GD-036, Ref 7.6) \n\nix. operator error probabilities:  \n\na.  should  reflect  the  complexity  of  the  task  required  and  the  factors \nwhich may be present which influence the performance of the operator \n(stress,  the  time  available,  training,  procedures  and  environmental \nconditions); \n\nb.  where  judgements  have  been  made,  the  basis  for  the  judgement  is \nstated and shown to be valid as far as possible; \n\nx.  the  measures  proposed  to  ensure  that  the  reliabilities  claimed  for \ncomponents  and  systems  will  be  achieved  and/or  maintained,  are  stated  and \nevidence is available to demonstrate the adequacy of any such measures; \n\nxi.  the  possibility  of  component  failure  rates  or  unavailabilities  increasing  with \ntime, e.g. through ageing, is considered. \n\n3)  Specific assessment expectations for review of the Data Analysis in PSAs for NPPs \ncan be found in Tables A1-2.5 (Human Reliability Analysis) and A1-2.6 (Data Analysis) \nof Appendix 1. \n\n5.9 \n\nAnalysis of Internal and External Hazards \n\n1)    Development  of  internal  and  external  hazard  PSA  generally  follows  a  similar \nmethod to the Level 1 internal events PSA method, i.e.: selection of IE (in this case a \nparticular  internal  or  external  hazard);  screening  and  bounding  of  the  IE;  accident \nsequence analysis and systems analysis. As such, the recommendations listed above \nare generally applicable for both hazard PSA and internal-events PSA. \n\n2)  Specific assessment expectations for review of the Analysis of Internal and External \nHazards in PSAs for NPPs can be found in Table A1-2.7 of Appendix 1.  \n\nReport : NS-TAST-GD-030 \nCM9 Ref: 2018/408246 \n\nPage 19 of 81 \n\n \n \n\n\fOffice for Nuclear Regulation  \n \n \n\n5.10  Analysis of Other Operating Modes \n\n1)  As stated above, the scope of a PSA is expected to address all operating modes \nwherein the nuclear facility is expected to operate. The recommendations listed above \nare generally also applicable for PSA models of operating modes other than \u2018at-power\u2019. \n\n2)    Specific  assessment  expectations  for  review  of  the  Analysis  of  Low  Power  and \nShutdown Modes in PSAs for NPPs can be found in Table A1-2.8 of Appendix 1. \n\n5.11  Evaluation of Release Frequencies \n\nSpecific  assessment  expectations  for  review  of  the  Level  2  PSA*  for  NPPs  can  be \nfound in Table A1-3 of Appendix 1. \n\n* For  NPPs, Level  1  PSA is the part of the  overall PSA that focuses  on the potential  for core \ndamage;  Level  2  PSA  widens  this  analysis  to  consider  release  magnitudes  and  frequencies \nfrom losses of containment or otherwise; while Level 3 PSA is wider still, and considers risks to \nthe public from off-site releases. \n\n \n\n5.12  Evaluation of Off-site Risks and Consequences \n\nSpecific assessment expectations for review of the Level 3 PSA for NPPs can be found \nin Table A1-4 of Appendix 1. \n\n5.13  Multi-unit considerations \n\nThe majority of existing and proposed nuclear sites in the UK contain multiple reactor \nunits or other facilities.  Whilst the topic of multi-unit PSA is a topic of ongoing \ninternational research, dutyholders are expected to consider the impact of multiple \nreactor units and other facilities within the PSA.  For existing sites with limited \ndependencies between individual facilities this may be limited to a single unit PSA for a \nrepresentative reactor unit or facility, supported by a justification for this approach \nproviding a suitable and sufficient PSA to support the expected PSA applications.  For \na new build site, or a site with significant or complex interactions between facilities, \nmore detailed analysis may be required. \n\nONR has an open research item on multi-unit PSA and provides a representative on \nOECD/NEA WGRISK and IAEA working groups for multi-unit PSA research topics.  \nFurther advice may be sought from inspectors involved in the ONR and international \nmulti-unit PSA research topics as required. \n\nThe following provides some general advice to inspectors on the different aspects of \nPSA relevant to multi-unit considerations: \n\n1) \n\n2) \n\nPSA scope.  As stated in Section 4.5, the scope of the PSA is expected to cover \nall significant sources of radioactivity on site.   The presence of multiple reactor \nunits and other facilities on a site should be taken into account when developing \nand justifying the scope of the PSA. \n\nPSA methodologies.  There are a number of options available to dutyholders \nwhen considering multiple reactor units or facilities within the PSA.  This may \nextend from justification that a single unit model adequately represents the site, \nall the way to a fully integrated multi-unit PSA covering all sources of radioactivity \non site, and various steps in-between.  There are advantages and disadvantages \nto the different approaches, depending upon the complexity of the site, the \ndependencies between the facilities, and the level of risk for the site.  The \napproach taken should be suitable to understand the risk and develop a suitable \nand sufficient PSA to support the expected PSA applications. \n\nReport : NS-TAST-GD-030 \nCM9 Ref: 2018/408246 \n\nPage 20 of 81 \n\n \n \n\n\fOffice for Nuclear Regulation  \n \n \n\n3) \n\n4) \n\n5) \n\n6) \n\n7) \n\n8) \n\nInitiating events.  Initiating events which affect multiple units or facilities should \nbe considered and analysed.  Initiating events which propagate between units or \nfacilities should also be considered and analysed. \n\nAccident sequence analysis.  Dependencies and the potential for propagation \nbetween units and facilities should be identified and suitably considered in the \nPSA.  This may include safety systems, support systems, control systems, \noperator actions, CCFs, phenomenology, and radiological consequences.  The \npotential for a radiological release at one facility to impact the operator response \non an adjacent facility should be considered. \n\nInput data.  Data used in the PSA model or any multi-unit sensitivity studies may \nbe impacted by the scope of the PSA, including CCFs, operator actions and \ninitiating event frequencies.  Data used in any multi-unit PSA models or studies \nshould be documented and justified.   \n\nInternal hazards.  The potential for propagation of internal hazards between units \nand facilities should be considered.  This may include tasks such as extending \nthe fire PSA multi compartment analysis to consider adjacent facilities. \n\nExternal hazards.  Many external hazards have the potential to impact multiple \nfacilities on the same site.  External hazard prioritisation and external hazards \nPSA models or sensitivity analysis should include consideration of all facilities \nwhich may be affected by the external hazard.  Additional analysis for seismic \nPSA may be required to consider the potential for correlation between SSCs in \ndifferent facilities. \n\nEvaluation of off-site consequences.  Additional consequence analysis may be \nrequired to evaluate the consequences of a multi-unit accident.  For example, a \nseismic event may be considered to lead to a release on multiple similar \nfacilities, with a similar or higher frequency than a single unit release, and \ntherefore additional consequence analysis should be performed. \n\n9)  Quantification and presentation of results.  PSA results should be quantified, \naggregated and presented in a suitable way to allow for comparison against \nSAPs numerical targets, understanding of sensitivity and uncertainty, \ndemonstration of risks being reduced to ALARP and use of PSA results to \nsupport the expected PSA applications. \n\n10) \n\nInterpretation of numerical targets.  SAPs Numerical Targets 7 and 9 relate to \nsite-wide risk, and therefore assessment against Numerical Targets 7 and 9 \nshould include consideration of all facilities on the site.  The SAPs contain a \ndefinition for societal risk (Target 9) which refers to \u201can activity from which risk is \nassessed as a whole and is under the control of one company in one location, or \nwithin a site boundary\u201d.  \n\nSAPs Numerical Target 8 relates to risk from a facility. The SAPs define a facility \nas \u201cA part of a nuclear site identified as being a separate unit for the purposes of \nnuclear or radiological risk\u201d. From a PSA point of view, dutyholders are expected \nto define the boundaries of each facility for the purposes of assessment against \nTarget 8.  This definition should include consideration of dependencies.  For \nexample, where facilities are coupled or connected, or multiple reactors are \ncontained in close proximity within the same building or the same body of water \nthey may be considered the same facility for the purposes of assessment against \nTarget 8.  \n\n5.14  Quantification of the Analysis \n\nReport : NS-TAST-GD-030 \nCM9 Ref: 2018/408246 \n\nPage 21 of 81 \n\n \n \n\n\fOffice for Nuclear Regulation  \n \n \n\n1)    The  PSA  should  determine  the  combinations  of  basic  events  such  as  component \nfailure,  CCF,  operator  error  and  plant  unavailability  which  lead  to  the  fault  sequence \nand  determine  its  frequency  of  occurrence.  The  methods  used  to  do  this  should  be \nidentified  and  shown  to  be  adequate.  Due  to  the  complexity  of  the  analysis,  the \nquantification of the PSA normally requires a computer program. This code should be \nquality  assured  (see  AV.4)  and  the  evidence  of  this  should  be  provided  by  the \ndutyholder (AV.5). \n\n2)  The inspector may consider whether: \n\ni.  where  computer  programs  are  used,  they  and  their  results  are  verified, \nthe \nmanual  calculations  should  have  been \ndutyholder; \n\nindependently  checked  by \n\nii.  the  combinations  of  basic  events  (minimal  cutsets)  which  lead  to  failure  of \nthe  protection  or  support  systems  are  identified  and  listed  for  each  of  the  IEs \nanalysed; \n\niii. that single order minimal cutsets are identified and brought to the attention of \nthe assessors dealing with compliance with the single failure criteria; \n\niv. the combinations of basic events do lead to the protection system failure (for \nthis,  inspectors  should  review  a  sample  of  the  cutsets  including  those  which \nmake the highest contributions to the frequency/probability calculated); \n\nv.  if the quantification of the analysis has required a restriction to be applied on \nthe  probability  of  the  combinations  of  basic  events  included,  this  has  not \naffected the accuracy of the analysis significantly; \n\nvi. in the calculation, all dependencies are taken into account. This includes the \ndependency  between  redundant  components,  between  nominally  diverse \nsystems and between individual operator errors. Dependencies due to common \nsupport systems should be modelled explicitly in the analysis; \n\nvii.  the  importance  of  IEs,  components,  systems,  operator  errors  and \ndependencies in the calculation of the risk have been identified. \n\n3)  Specific assessment expectations for review of the Quantification of PSAs for NPPs \ncan be found in Table A1-2.9.2 of Appendix 1. \n\n5.15  Sensitivity and Uncertainty Studies \n\n1)  The results of the probabilistic analysis may be sensitive to the assumptions made \nand  the  data  used.  Since  these  contain  some  uncertainty,  studies  should  be  carried \nout to determine the degree of sensitivity to ensure that the conclusions drawn from the \nanalysis are still valid in the light of these uncertainties (AV.6). These sensitivity studies \nshould cover a sufficiently wide range of conditions to give confidence in the accuracy \nof the results of the analysis and the conclusions drawn from it.

This  is  presented  in  the  form  of  a  Table  of  Assessment \nExpectations for different stages in the lifecycle of a nuclear power plant, i.e. PSAs submitted \nfor  generic  design  assessment  (GDA),  site  licensing,  reactor  commissioning  and  to  support \nNPP  operation.  Inspectors  should  bear  in  mind  that  much  of  the  guidance  provided  in \nAppendix 1 can also be applied to other types of installations. \n\nA1-1.2    There  is  an  expectation  that  dutyholders  will  present  the  PSA  analysis  within  a \nframework compatible with good industry practices. For NPPs this suggests a traditional Level \n1, 2, 3 PSA framework as presented in IAEA Guidance (Refs A1-4.1 \u2013 A1-4.4). Inspectors will \ngain  confidence  in  the  acceptability  of  risk  from  the  facility  and  ALARP  compliance  by \nreviewing the facility risk level against the numerical targets of the SAPs and the probabilistic \ncriteria  proposed  by  INSAG  (Ref  A1-4.5),  which  implies  a  need  to  calculate  the  appropriate \nrisk figures of merit including core damage frequency and large release frequency. \n\nA1-1.3  However, in order to address the relevant numerical targets of the SAPs, dutyholders \nwill also need to identify and study those sequences that have a higher frequency but lower \nradiological  consequence.  As  an  example,  in  PWRs,  Steam  Generator  Tube  Rupture \nsequences without core damage could lead to releases in the lower dose bands of Numerical \nTarget 8 of the SAPs. The guidance in this Appendix does not specifically cover assessment \nexpectations for PSA studies addressing release categories for non-core damage sequences. \nONR prefers that dutyholders present the PSAs for NPPs in the traditional Level 1, 2, 3 PSA \nframework  as  discussed  above,  addressing  release  categories  for  non-core  damage \nsequences separately.  \n\nA1-1.4  Other aspects not specifically covered by the guidance in this Appendix include worker \nrisk and risk from facilities at the NPP other than the nuclear reactor. Nevertheless, these risks \nneed to be evaluated by the dutyholders in order to address the relevant numerical targets of \nthe SAPs.  \n\nA1-2  Not used \n\nReport : NS-TAST-GD-030 \nCM9 Ref: 2018/408246 \n\n \n \n\nPage 24 of 81 \n\n\fOffice for Nuclear Regulation  \n \n \n\nA1-3  Use of this Appendix \nA1-3.1    The  Tables  in  this  Appendix  present  check  lists  of  items  that  inspectors  should \ngenerally expect to see when assessing the different areas of the PSAs for nuclear reactors. \nThe aim is to address all key aspects of modern PSA for nuclear reactors to help inspectors to \nassess,  raise  comments,  questions  and  issues  in  a  focused  and  systematic  fashion,  and, \nfinally, judge the adequacy of each feature of the PSAs submitted by the dutyholders.  \n\nA1-3.2  Although an attempt has been made to make this appendix comprehensive, it is only \nmeant  for  guidance  and  by  no  means  should  be  taken  to  imply  that  inspectors  have  no \ndiscretion when choosing the scope and depth of the assessment to be undertaken.  \n\nA1-3.3  In addition, it should be stressed that  is not the intention of Appendix 1 to prescribe \nspecific methods and approaches for conducting PSA for NPPs. Dutyholders may choose to \nuse alternative methods to those covered in this appendix as long as they are shown to lead \nto  equally  valid  outcomes.  In  cases  where  the  PSA  or  specific  areas  of  it  have  been \nundertaken using alternative approaches, inspectors, should review on a case-by-case basis \nand judge each on its own merits.  \n\nA1-3.4  This Appendix can be used in a more prescriptive manner when commissioning PSA \nassessment  work  (to  be  done  on  behalf  of  ONR)  from  external  contractors.  In  such  cases, \ninspectors may wish to restrict the use of discretion by the contractor and/or specify the scope \nand depth of assessment. \n\nA1-4  References \nA1-4.1  INTERNATIONAL ATOMIC ENERGY AGENCY, Safety Assessment and Verification \nfor  Nuclear  Power  Plants,  Safety  Standards  Series,  Safety  Guide  NS-G-1.2,  IAEA,  Vienna \n(2001) \n\n \n\nINTERNATIONAL  ATOMIC  ENERGY  AGENCY,  Procedures \n\nA1-4.2 \nfor  Conducting \nProbabilistic Safety Assessment of Nuclear Power Plants (Level 1), Safety Series No 50-P-4, \nIAEA, Vienna (1992) \n\n \n\nINTERNATIONAL  ATOMIC  ENERGY  AGENCY,  Procedures \n\nA1-4.3 \nfor  Conducting \nProbabilistic  Safety  Assessments  of  Nuclear  Power  Plants  (Level  2):  Accident  Progression, \nContainment  Analysis  and  Estimation  of  Accident  Source  Terms,  Safety  Series  No.  50-P-8, \nIAEA, Vienna, 1995 \n\n \n\nINTERNATIONAL  ATOMIC  ENERGY  AGENCY,  Procedures \n\nA1-4.4 \nfor  Conducting \nProbabilistic Safety Assessments of Nuclear Power Plants (Level 3), IAEA-Safety Series 50-P-\n12, IAEA, Vienna (1996). \n\nA1-4.5  INTERNATIONAL NUCLEAR SAFETY ADVISORY GROUP, Basic Safety Principles \nfor Nuclear Power Plants, 75-INSAG-3 Rev. 1, INSAG-12, IAEA, Vienna (1999) \n\nA1-5  Bibliography \nA1-5.1    AMERICAN  SOCIETY  OF  MECHANICAL  ENGINEERS,  Standard  for  Probabilistic \nRisk Assessment for Nuclear Power Plant Applications, ASME RA-S-1.4-2013 (2013) \n\nA1-5.2    AMERICAN  NUCLEAR  SOCIETY,  External  Events  PRA  Methodology,  American \nNational Standard, ANSI/ANS-58.21-2007 (2007) \n\nA1-5.3    EPRI/NRC-RES,  Fire  PRA  Methodology  for  Nuclear  Power  Facilities,  NUREG/CR-\n6850 (2005) \n\nA1-5.4    AMERICAN  NUCLEAR  SOCIETY,  Fire  PRA  Methodology,  American  National \nStandard, ANSI/ANS-58.23-2007 (2007) \n\nA1-5.5    EUROPEAN  UTILITY  REQUIREMENTS  FOR  LWR  NUCLEAR  POWER  PLANTS, \nVolume 2: Generic Nuclear Island Requirements \u2013 Chapter 17: PSA Methodology, Revision C \n(2001) \n\nReport : NS-TAST-GD-030 \nCM9 Ref: 2018/408246 \n\nPage 25 of 81 \n\n \n \n\n\fOffice for Nuclear Regulation  \n \n \n\n \n\nINTERNATIONAL  ATOMIC  ENERGY  AGENCY,  Determining \n\nA1-5.6 \nthe  quality  of \nprobabilistic  safety  assessment  (PSA)  for  applications  in  nuclear  power  plants,  IAEA-\nTECDOC-1511, IAEA, Vienna (2006) \n\nA1-5.7    INTERNATIONAL  ATOMIC  ENERGY  AGENCY,  Development  and  Application  of \nLevel 1 Probabilistic Safety Assessment for Nuclear Power Plants, Specific Safety Guide No. \nSSG-3.

The principles presented in the SAPs are supported \nby a suite of guides to further assist ONR\u2019s inspectors in their technical assessment \nwork in support of making regulatory judgements and decisions.  This Technical \nAssessment Guide (TAG) is one of these guides. \n\n2. \n\nPURPOSE AND SCOPE \n\nONR has the responsibility for regulating the safety of nuclear installations in Great \nBritain. The SAPs for Nuclear Facilities [1] provide a framework to guide regulatory \ndecision-making in the nuclear permissioning process. The SAPs are supported by \nTAGs which further aid the decision-making process.  \n\nThis TAG provides guidance to aid Inspectors in the interpretation and application of \nSAPs related to procedure design and the use of administrative controls, specifically \nSAPs EHF.4 and EHF.9. It also assists with the application of other SAPs which set \nout expectations regarding administrative safety measures and procedures designed \nand implemented by a dutyholder, including those related to compliance with \nOperating Rules.  \n\nThe TAG provides broad expectations on key points that the experienced Human \nFactors (HF) Inspector may wish to consider when judging whether a licensee\u2019s \nprocedures and administrative safety controls are designed and implemented \neffectively. This TAG is not intended to be a detailed design guide for procedures and \nadministrative controls; nor does it prescribe specific methods and approaches for \nassessing them or offer guidance on how to judge the adequacy of their technical \ncontent. Inspectors should exercise their own judgement and discretion in the depth \nand scope to which they apply the guidance, but should be cognisant of the safety \nreliance that is placed on human action and the contribution that failure to implement \nthe administrative controls and procedures makes to risk.  \n\nProcedures and Administrative Control  \n\nSAP EKP.5 sets out a hierarchy of preferred options for delivering safety functions and \nmaintaining the plant within its safe operating envelope. The SAP identifies the \npreference for passive safety measures, but sets out alternatives including the use of \nadministrative safety measures where an engineered control is not possible or \nreasonably practicable to implement. Where administrative safety measures are \nproposed, the safety case should include a robust justification demonstrating why \nalternative measures are not reasonably practicable, and showing that claims on the \nadministrative safety measure can be substantiated.  \n\nProcedures form an essential part of any administrative safety measure. The \nmechanisms in place to ensure that procedures are designed in accordance with good \npractice HF guidelines, such that they support the end user and reflect safety case \nrequirements will influence the reliability with which safety significant tasks are \ncontrolled and should form part of the substantiation. Administrative safety measures \nmay be defined as Operating Instructions in accordance with Licence Condition (LC) \n24(1). \n\n \n1. \n\n1.1 \n\n2.1 \n\n2.2 \n\n2.3 \n\n2.4 \n\n2.5 \n\n \n\n \n\nNS-TAST-GD-060 \nTRIM Ref: 2017/438046 \n\nPage 2 of 16 \n\n \n \n\n\fOffice for Nuclear Regulation  \n \n \n\nDefinitions  \n\n2.6 \n\nThis TAG uses the term \u2018procedures\u2019 to refer to all written instructions that describe the \nway in which operations affecting safety should be carried out. The term \u2018Operating \nInstruction\u2019 is used within LC 24. Licensees use a range of terminology for LC 24 \noperating instructions and this term is generally taken to mean, but is not limited to, \nprocedures. As much of what is carried out on operating sites is controlled by lower \nlevel documents that support \u2018operating instructions\u2019 the term \u2018procedures\u2019 has been \nused to indicate the broader application of the guidance within this TAG.  \n\n2.7 \n\nAdministrative control within this TAG refers to a safety measure that is claimed to \nmaintain operations within the plant\u2019s safe operating envelope derived from the safety \ncase, and which is implemented by operator action  \n\n3. \n\nRELATIONSHIP TO LICENCE AND OTHER RELEVANT LEGISLATION  \n\n3.1 \n\n3.2 \n\n3.3 \n\nThe Nuclear Site LCs [2] place legal requirements on the licensee to make and \nimplement arrangements to ensure that safety is being adequately managed. The \nlicence conditions provide a legal framework which can be drawn on in assessment.  \n\nLCs 23 (limits and conditions in the interests of safety) and 24 (Operating Instructions) \nparticularly apply. Also of relevance are LCs 14 and 15 (preparation and review of \nsafety cases), LC 11 (emergency arrangements), LC 17 (quality management), and LC \n28 (examination, inspection, maintenance and testing). Most other licence conditions \nalso touch on the topic of procedures and administrative controls. Procedures \nproviding guidance and instruction to staff are instrumental in ensuring that all activities \nthroughout the life cycle of an installation are carried out reliably and efficiently such \nthat the potential for introduction of errors is minimised.  \n\nRegulation 3(1) of The Management of Health and Safety Work Regulations 1999 \nplaces a legal requirement on dutyholders to produce suitable and sufficient risk \nassessments and Regulation 4 the requirement to introduce preventive and protective \nmeasures to control risk. In order to be considered suitable and sufficient, such \nassessments may need to identify and consider the need for and influence of, suitable \nand sufficient procedures and administrative controls as part of the dutyholder\u2019s \nmeasures for controlling risk.  \n\n4. \n\nRELATIONSHIP TO SAPS, WENRA REFERENCE LEVELS, AND IAEA SAFETY \nSTANDARDS  \n\n4.1 \n\nSAPS  \n \nONR\u2019s expectations concerning the adequacy of administrative controls and \nprocedures are set out in a number of SAPs.

The licensee should be able to demonstrate that \nits administrative controls and procedures are designed and implemented such that \nthey support reliable human performance of actions that keep the plant within the safe \noperating envelope. The guidance provided in this section can be used to assess all \ntypes of procedures and administrative controls.  \n\nGeneral Expectations  \n \nInspectors should seek to gain confidence that safety claims made upon administrative \ncontrols and procedures can be substantiated. This may involve considering:  \n\n5.2 \n\n\u2022 \n\n\u2022 \n\n\u2022 \n\n\u2022 \n\nthe dutyholder\u2019s process for identifying the need for administrative controls and \nprocedural support within the safety case;  \n\nits capability \u2013 often embedded in its HF resource - to support effective \nspecification and design of administrative controls and procedures, drawing \nupon a proportionate use of task analysis;  \n\nthe processes in place to ensure that administrative controls and procedures \nare implemented effectively and are subject to suitable management controls, \nfor example configuration control and review of modifications; \n\nlearning from experience, for example implementing appropriate improvements \nfollowing events, feedback for personnel following use (during operation, \ntraining, drills, etc.), periodic reviews of safety, etc.   \n\nClaims on administrative control should be identified and assessed from a HF \nperspective in all operating states commensurate with their risk. Where a high reliance \nis placed upon the administrative control, it would be expected that a detailed HF \nassessment involving the use of task analysis would be conducted and robust \njustification made for the usability and reliability of that control. ONR expects \nHF/ergonomics principles and practices to be incorporated in the design, specification, \nimplementation and through-life management of procedures and administrative \ncontrols. It should be noted that procedures are only one of the factors affecting the \nreliability of operator action associated with implementation of administrative controls. \nOther factors such as Human-Machine Interface (HMI), task design, supervision and \ntraining will also be relevant, and the Inspector should recognise this when defining \ninterventions.  \n\n \n5.3 \n\n5.4 \n\nKey elements for ensuring the provision of suitable and sufficient administrative control \nand procedures to support the safe operation of nuclear plant include explicit \nconsideration of:  \n\n\u2022  The nature of the task and human-based safety claim related to the delivery of \n\n\u2022  The safety goal to be achieved,  \n\nadministrative safety functions  \n\n\u2022  The needs of the end user  \n\n \n5.5 \n\nInspectors may consider whether:  \n\nNS-TAST-GD-060 \nTRIM Ref: 2017/438046 \n\nPage 5 of 16 \n\n \n \n\n\fOffice for Nuclear Regulation  \n \n \n\n\u2022  The dutyholder\u2019s process for the identification of administrative control \n\nrequirements draws upon the safety case and covers all plant operational \nmodes/states including maintenance, testing and calibration activities, override \nfacilities, fault and emergency response.  \n\n\u2022  Where appropriate, the dutyholder\u2019s administrative controls take into account \n\nthe need to demonstrate compliance with conditions and limits necessary in \nthe interests of safety; detect non-compliance and facilitate the successful \nperformance of recovery actions. This includes factors such as supervision and \nsurveillance tasks, compliance records, alarm set points, the communication of \ntime constraints associated with non-compliance, operator awareness and \ntraining about the safety limits and conditions.  \n\n\u2022  Administrative controls and the associated safety-related activities that \n\noperators need to carry out to achieve compliance with operating rules are \nclearly identified as such in operating instructions. The instructions clearly state \nwhat needs to done, when, by whom, under what circumstances, the success \ncriteria for each activity and actions to be taken if an operating rule is \nbreached.  \n\n\u2022  The specification and design of administrative control (and procedures) is \n\nincluded as part of the dutyholder\u2019s Human Factors Integration (HFI) process \n(see Technical Assessment Guide NS-TAST-GD-058 \u2013 Human Factors \nIntegration [8]).  \n\n\u2022  The dutyholder has declared and justified the standards/guidelines used for the \n\ndesign/modification and substantiation of its administrative controls.  \n\n\u2022  The actions being claimed are \n\no  feasible, \n\no  potential for human error is identified and minimised to As Low As \n\nReasonably Practicable (ALARP) and \n\no  the actions can be carried out with an appropriate level of reliability given \n\nthe equipment, procedures and operator interfaces provided.  \n\n\u2022  The dutyholder has considered each individual administrative control to \n\nconsider management of safety issues that can contribute to the adequate \nimplementation of the controls, such as competency assurance and \nmanagement actions to ensure compliance. The following aspects should be \nevident in the dutyholder\u2019s design of administrative controls:  \n\no  Task requirements, potential for errors/violations and demands placed \n\nupon operators are clearly identified and understood;  \n\no  Adequacy of the supporting systems, such as the interfaces and \n\nprocedures that operators are reliant on to implement the administrative \ncontrol;  \n\no  Competence levels and training of operators to perform the task;  \n\no  Task environment/context including Performance Shaping Factors and \n\nthe prevailing safety culture to support operator performance.  \n\n\u2022  The dutyholder\u2019s arrangements include elements of evaluation, verification, \n\nvalidation and review.  \n\n\u2022  The dutyholder has carried out an operational experience review (existing or \nsimilar plants), including a review of any simulations or mock-ups of its \nproposed administrative controls.  \n\nNS-TAST-GD-060 \nTRIM Ref: 2017/438046 \n\nPage 6 of 16 \n\n \n \n\n\fOffice for Nuclear Regulation  \n \n \n\n\u2022  The dutyholder can demonstrate that the design and specification of \n\nadministrative controls has been used as an input to the design of procedures \nand operator training needs/competence requirements.  \n\n\u2022  The dutyholder has conducted suitable evaluation and testing/trials of the \n\ndesign, specification, implementation and use of administrative controls and \nprocedures to demonstrate their effectiveness in the context of the safety case \nclaims and assumptions.  \n\nDependency in claims on administrative control  \n \nThe impact of dependency on the reliability of the administrative control should be \nconsidered as this is an importance failure mechanism that is often overlooked or \ninadequately defended against. Whilst the design of administrative controls should aim \nto minimise dependency, it can be difficult to identify, or eliminate, all forms of \ndependency in human actions, such that claims on multiple human actions to offer high \nlevels of protection are likely to be unrealistic. Claims on several \u2018independent\u2019 \nadministrative controls in order to claim an unrealistically high level of protection \nshould therefore be avoided.  \n\n5.7 \n\nInspectors may consider whether:  \n\n\u2022  The dutyholder has identified dependent failure mechanisms associated with \n\nits administrative controls and has implemented credible defences and \nmitigations against dependency where these effects are identified.  \n\nAssessment of administrative controls  \n\nThis section provides general advice to the Inspector regarding good practice \nexpectations for the assessment and substantiation of administrative controls. The \nguidance provided in T/AST/063 on Human Reliability Analysis is also relevant.  \n\n5.9 \n\nInspectors may consider whether:  \n\n \n\n5.6 \n\n \n\n \n5.8 \n\n\u2022  Where a high reliance is placed on administrative control or it delivers an \n\nimportant safety function, the dutyholder has used task analysis and drawn \nupon end user input to understand the task and demonstrate the suitability, \nfeasibility and reliability of the associated operator actions and managerial \narrangements. These include but are not limited to:  \n\no  The operating instructions and the extent to which they clearly and \n\nunambiguously prescribe any required actions and success criteria for \nthe administrative controls.  \n\no  Performance shaping factors and error mechanisms associated with \ncontext in which administrative controls are implemented including, \nwhere appropriate, the dynamic nature of these.  \n\no  The provision of adequate human-system interfaces; in providing \n\nindication of safety-related parameters and their associated operating \nlimits, whether in a central control room or local-to-plant.  \n\no  Operator awareness of the required actions and their role as defined \n\nwithin the safety case.  \n\no  Operator training and competence for the specific tasks to be performed.  \n\nNS-TAST-GD-060 \nTRIM Ref: 2017/438046 \n\nPage 7 of 16 \n\n \n \n\n\fOffice for Nuclear Regulation  \n \n \n\no  The prevailing culture within the relevant parts of the operating \n\norganisation.  \n\n\u2022  Where feasible, the dutyholder has used simulator trials to support the analysis \nof administrative controls. Alternatively, the dutyholder has conducted walk-\nthrough/talk-through or observation of the use of administrative controls to \nconfirm that users are familiar with the controls and fluent in their use.  \n\n \nOther Administrative Controls  \n \n\n5.10  The Inspector should note that administrative controls with an impact on safety extend \nbeyond those directly involved in the execution of activities such as operations or \nmaintenance. These include, for example, controls such as Permit to Work, use of \nwaivers, temporary instructions etc. The Inspector should seek confidence that the \nlicensee\u2019s arrangements for these other controls are adequate.  \n\n5.11 \n\nInspectors may consider whether:  \n\n\u2022  The dutyholder has a system to identify and assess administrative controls \nindirectly or implicitly claimed to provide assurance of the level of protection \nassumed within the safety case.  \n\n\u2022  The dutyholder has adequately substantiated the robustness and reliability of \n\nthe following where they are claimed, either implicitly or explicitly, to provide \nadequate nuclear safety:  \n\no  Administrative controls used for configuration and surveillance and \nmaintenance of automatically initiated engineered safety systems.  \n\no  Administrative controls used as a substitute for an engineered safety \n\nsystem e.g. during a planned or unplanned outage, or for short-term high \nrisk activities.  \n\no  Temporary instructions, workarounds and/or Permit-to-Work systems that \nmay be used to implement temporary safety measures as an alternative \nto provide adequate safety during unplanned engineered safety system \noutages, or to act as the controls for non-routine hazardous activities.  \n\no  Override facilities; safe use of overrides and vetoes is dependent on \neffective administrative control. Inspectors should check that the \nadministrative control arrangements ensure that operators understand \nthe plant state and any change in plant state associated with the \nrequirement for and application of an override and that is recognised by \nall personnel who may at risk in order to avoid inadvertent actions being \ntaken and unintentionally creating a significant hazard.  \n\n\u2022  The dutyholder has adequate arrangements for conducting periodic audit to \n\nensure that the level of control can be (and is being) maintained over a period \nof time.  \n\n \nProcedures  \n \n\n5.12  This section is intended to supplement Technical Inspection Guide (TIG) NS-INSP-GD-\n\n024 [9] (LC 24 Operating Instructions) rather than repeat the information contained \ntherein. It is recommended that the reader also refers to NS-INSP-GD-024 as part of \ntheir inspection and/or assessment.  \n\nGeneral Expectations  \n\nNS-TAST-GD-060 \nTRIM Ref: 2017/438046 \n\n \n \n\nPage 8 of 16 \n\n\fOffice for Nuclear Regulation  \n \n \n\n5.13  All activities which may affect safety should be carried out in accordance with written \nprocedures. However, carrying out activities in accordance with procedures does not \nnecessarily mean that there must be a procedure in hand, followed step by step for \nevery task. Decisions on the way that procedures are used to support consistent and \nreliable task performance must be based on the nature of the task, its safety \nsignificance, the potential for error and the experience of the user. The inspector \nshould consider whether:  \n\n\u2022  The dutyholder\u2019s operating instructions are consistent with any operating rules \nthey implement. This includes any procedures that provide indirect support to \noperating rules, such as those involved in the maintenance of safety related \nplant.  \n\n\u2022  The dutyholder\u2019s procedures define how plant should be brought back within \n\noperating rule limits and conditions if discovered to be outwith these.  \n\nManagement arrangements  \n\n \n5.14 \n\nIt is also important for the inspector to recognise the role of lower level procedures in \nassuring safety, as the presence and use of these is often implicitly assumed within the \nsafety case. The dutyholder is expected to consider the role of such procedures in \ndelivering safety. Inspectors may consider whether:  \n\n\u2022  The dutyholder has a controlled process for the production, maintenance, \nreview, amendment and version control of procedures. Mechanisms are in \nplace to ensure that the safety case is not undermined by subsequent changes \nto procedures and vice versa  \n\n\u2022  The dutyholder has a process for validation and verification of procedures, \n\nwhich includes: end user involvement, consideration of the way they are used \nto confirm their technical accuracy and usability.  \n\n\u2022  Consideration of assumptions within the safety case to ensure that the safety \n\ncase is not undermined.  \n\n\u2022  The dutyholder has a process of learning from experience to ensure \n\nprocedures are appropriately revised based on use. Changes that are made as \na result of this process should be evaluated to ensure that the procedure has \ndelivered its intended improvement.  \n\n\u2022  The dutyholder\u2019s modification and change management process has the \n\ncapacity to identify all design, organisational and safety case changes that may \nimpact procedures and the process should have the capacity to identify \nprocedures that are obsolete.  \n\n\u2022  The dutyholder can demonstrate the suitability and sufficiency of the procedure \n\nto support safe and reliable task performance. For example, through \nimplementation of a hierarchy of procedure classification relating to the safety \nsignificance of the operations, its complexity and frequency to inform the \nassignment of a category of procedure format, use and availability. This may \ninclude \u2018use categories\u2019 similar to the following:  \n\no  Level 1 \u2013 Continuous use; where the procedure is \u2018in-hand\u2019 and referred \n\nto step by step each time the task is performed.  \n\no  Level 2 \u2013 Reference use; the procedure is available at the work location \nand may be referred to periodically during the performance of a task and \nrelevant blocks of task steps are verified to confirm that all steps have \nbeen completed.  \n\no  Level 3 \u2013 Information use; the procedure is available for use as needed.  \n\n \n \n\nNS-TAST-GD-060 \nTRIM Ref: 2017/438046 \n\nPage 9 of 16 \n\n\fOffice for Nuclear Regulation  \n \n \n\n\u2022  The dutyholder maintains accurate records to demonstrate compliance with \n\noperating procedures in line with LC 25(1)  \n\n\u2022  The dutyholder\u2019s procedures are clearly linked with the claims and \n\nassumptions in the safety case and the procedures have been developed \nbased on the output of the Design Basis Analysis (DBA), PSA and Safety \nAssessment (SA), appropriate to the specific procedures.  \n\nProcedure Design and Methods  \n\n \n5.15  The development of technically accurate and usable procedures will rely on the \n\napplication of appropriate methods such as task analysis and on the quality of the \nverification and validation processes. Engaging procedure users in the development \nand amendment of procedures will also increase both the accuracy and validity of the \nprocedure. The rigour applied to the development of procedures should reflect the \nrelative contribution to safety of the task being controlled. The methods adopted should \nbe appropriate to the nature of the task or process.  \n\n5.16 \n\nInspectors may consider whether:  \n\n\u2022  The dutyholder uses a systematic and defined process to develop procedures \nand this includes proportionate use of internal and/or external standards or \nguidelines and the practices listed below, to ensure the uptake of relevant \ngood practice in procedure writing and to ensure consistency of presentation \nand format (see for example references [10], [11] & [12]).  \n\no  Task analysis.  \n\no  Desktop or walk-through/talk-through approaches, wherein operators use \nthe procedures and verify their accuracy and suitability for the task and \nthe options available to them at each step.  \n\no  Simulator, or some other high fidelity method, is used wherever possible \n\nand in particular for post-fault actions.  \n\n\u2022  The dutyholder has a responsive approach for updating procedures, from the \nuser point of view. This is important to motivate change where it is needed. \nThis process identifies the safety implications of such changes to ensure that \nthe safety case is not undermined.  \n\n\u2022  The dutyholder is able to demonstrate that the standard of procedures used by \ncontractors is commensurate with what is expected from the dutyholder\u2019s own \ninternally developed procedures.  \n\n\u2022  The dutyholder uses its procedures to inform the identification and delivery of \ncompetence and training needs associated with particular tasks to ensure that \nthese are clearly defined and that associated procedures do not assume any \nknowledge and skill for which the user has not been trained and is competent \nto carry out. The process also includes any unfamiliar/infrequently used \nprocedures e.g. annual maintenance instructions, fault and emergency \nresponse procedures.  \n\n\u2022  The dutyholder has clearly identified roles and responsibilities with regard to \nprocedures. There is a reasonably practicable process for ensuring that \nprocedure compliance is assured and demonstrated and this covers \nmanagement expectations about compliance.  \n\n\u2022  The dutyholder\u2019s procedures are provided in an appropriate format. \n\nNS-TAST-GD-060 \nTRIM Ref: 2017/438046 \n\nPage 10 of 16 \n\n \n \n\n\fOffice for Nuclear Regulation  \n \n \n\no  Procedures should provide suitable navigation aids and be consistent in \ntheir use of cautions, warnings, hold points and independent verification \nto control safety significant task steps.  \n\no  A \u201cone size fits all\u201d approach to procedure formatting is unlikely to be \nappropriate. For example, an appropriate procedure format for use in \nnormal operations might be very differently from one to be used following \nan accident / incident.   Different formats might be appropriate to support \nthe specific task requirements (e.g. sequential for normal operations, \nsymptom-based for design base faults, state / event based for severe \naccidents, etc.).   \n\no  Procedures should also support their users through the potential difficult \ntransition between normal and abnormal conditions (and back again).  It \nshould be clear to the user the appropriate procedure they need to use in \nresponse to the specific scenario they face. \n\no  Where independent verification is used, it should be clear what is being \n\nchecked and how, such that any sign-off is meaningful to the verifier. The \nprocedure user should be made aware of the significance of the step \nthrough its clear demarcation within the procedure and through training.  \n\n\u2022  The dutyholder can demonstrate an understanding of safety significant task \n\nsteps in the procedures and any errors that may occur; these have been given \nconsideration in the design and maintenance of procedure quality.  \n\nPlant Commissioning Procedures  \n\n \n5.17  The general expectations for procedures, their design and methods of production \n\nequally apply to procedures that are used for commissioning. However, during \ncommissioning operations are often performed with the plant in unusual and changing \nconfigurations. Procedures must still be available under such circumstances. \nCommissioning procedures are likely to be more detailed and require the bases of the \ncontents of the procedure to be explicit. During later operation, once the procedures \nhave been tested in use, this additional detail may no longer be required within the \nprocedure itself. The dutyholder should detail the bases upon which the commissioning \nprocedure content is decided and verified. This should also be linked to the safety \ncase, training and competency assessments.  \n\nComputerised Operating Procedures  \n\n \n5.18  Advances in digital technology are resulting in increasing availability of Computerised \nOperating Procedures (COPs), for assisting operators with various plant control tasks, \nfault diagnosis and response [13], [14]. The purpose of this section is to provide high \nlevel guidance to inspectors where the licensee proposes to use such systems.  \n\n5.19  ONR considers COPs to be any computer application that presents operating \n\nprocedures/instructions through electronic, rather than printed, media. This is taken to \ninclude procedure-based automation whereby the evaluation and execution of a \npredefined sequence of procedure steps is carried out by a computerised \noperating system.  \n\n5.20 \n\nIn their simplest form, computer-based procedures simply represent the procedure text \nin electronic form. This type of COPs may include the ability to call up another relevant \nprocedure from a hyper-link in the procedure and allow the user to track progress \nthrough the procedure steps. More sophisticated COPs may automate the gathering \nand display of plant data relevant to a task and procedure step. They incorporate \nadditional functionality such as automated data gathering and processing capability, \nevaluation of plant parameters and procedure step logic, and the display of the results \n\nNS-TAST-GD-060 \nTRIM Ref: 2017/438046 \n\nPage 11 of 16 \n\n \n \n\n\fOffice for Nuclear Regulation  \n \n \n\nto the operator to support decision-making and/or prompt the operator to take a \nspecific action. This type of COP may also provide links to soft controls where \noperators may take plant control actions.  \n\n5.21  Further advanced COPs include all the functionality above and also have the ability to \n\nissue plant control commands and automatically carry out a pre-defined sequence of \nprocedure steps once authorised by the operator. This type of COP can make \ndecisions as to whether and when to execute each step in the procedure sequence \nbased on real time plant conditions.  \n\n5.22  Regardless of the type of COPs proposed by dutyholders, it is important to recognise \nthat operators are responsible for the proper application of any procedures and COPs \nare an operator aid for controlling the plant. In the case of automatically executed \nactions it is expected that this is flagged to the operator in such way that he can reach \na judgement on their suitability. Loss of an aid should not prevent the operator from \nperforming any required safety and control actions. In addition, failure of COPs should \nnot have any impact on safety systems or control systems.  \n\n5.23  The same general principles applied to the design of paper-based procedures also \napply to COPs in terms of presentation principles, processes for updating, verifying \nand validating etc. However, there are other specific issues that must be addressed if \nCOPs are to be used including the consideration of Human Machine Interface (HMI) \nand software design and verification [15] \u2013 [19]. (See also NS-TAST-GD-059 \u2013 Human \nMachine Interface [20]).  \n\n5.24  Where the dutyholder uses, or proposes to use, COPs, Inspectors may consider \n\nwhether:  \n\n\u2022  The choice and use of COPs is appropriate for the operational concept, tasks \n\nand safety functions to be delivered.  \n\n\u2022  The COPs are designed and implemented such that operators remain in \n\ncommand of the plant and processes being operated. Operator pre-defined \nhold-points are included in the COP that defines the start and end of any \nautomated sequences that are commanded by the operator.  \n\n\u2022  The operator should be able to manually interrupt a COP execution safely and \nat any point in a sequence of steps. Any automatic interrupts include a salient \nalerting function and identify the cause of why the sequence has stopped. The \noperator should be able to revert to manual control or resume automatic \nprocedure execution if desired.  \n\n\u2022  COPs provide adequate information on initial plant conditions that must be met \n\nbefore any automated sequence may be started.  \n\n\u2022  COPs that process plant data and evaluate procedure-step logic can only \n\nmake deterministic decisions (e.g. yes/no) and all data evaluated by a COP is \navailable to the operator. The results evaluated by the COP are the same as \nthose expected from operator evaluations of the same procedure steps.  \n\n\u2022  Failure modes or loss of the COP can be readily detected and identified by \noperators and these do not affect the operator\u2019s ability to safely recover and \noperate the plant.  \n\n\u2022  COPs should not determine what procedure should be used; the operator \nshould decide what procedure to be used for a given task in any given \nsituation.  \n\n\u2022  Suitable back-up procedures are accessible and available (alternate COPs or \npaper-based procedures) in case of COP failure. The structure and format of \n\nNS-TAST-GD-060 \nTRIM Ref: 2017/438046 \n\nPage 12 of 16 \n\n \n \n\n\fOffice for Nuclear Regulation  \n \n \n\nthe information in the back-up procedures is consistent and compatible with \nthat in the COP. Consideration has been given to the feasibility of the means of \ntransition to back-up procedures. The time required for the operator to \neffectively transfer to back-up procedures should be known and demonstrated \nto be feasible within required timeframes determined in the safety case. After \ntransferring to a back up procedure the operator should be able to safely stop \nthe processing of the COP.  \n\n\u2022  COPs should be commanded and controlled by a single dedicated operator \nwith multiple read-only facilities displaying the COP elsewhere to assist the \noperating team/crew situational awareness.  \n\n\u2022  COPs provide adequate feedback to operators informing them of what the \n\ncurrent state of procedure execution is and what the system being controlled is \ndoing.  \n\n\u2022  The COPs conspicuously display the current system mode and have the ability \n\nto alert the operator should an unexpected mode or state change occur.  \n\n\u2022  The characteristics and behaviours of any embedded soft controls in a COP \n\nare consistent and compatible with other plant controls and user expectations.  \n\n\u2022  There is a robust COP management and configuration control process to \n\nensure that COP content and functionality are fully verified and validated prior \nto use and following any changes.

This document contains Fundamental Security \nPrinciples (FSyPs) that dutyholders must demonstrate have been fully taken into \naccount in developing their security arrangements to meet relevant legal obligations. \nThe security regime for meeting these principles is described in security plans \nprepared by the dutyholders, which are approved by ONR under the Nuclear Industries \nSecurity Regulations (NISR) 2003 (Reference 2). \n\nThe term \u2018security plan\u2019 is used to cover all dutyholder submissions such as nuclear \nsite security plans, temporary security plans and transport security statements. NISR \nRegulation 22 dutyholders may also use the SyAPs as the basis for Cyber Security \nand Information Assurance (CS&IA) documentation that helps them demonstrate \nongoing legal compliance for the protection of Sensitive Nuclear Information (SNI). The \nSyAPs are supported by a suite of guides to assist ONR inspectors in their \nassessment and inspection work, and in making regulatory judgements and decisions.  \nThis Technical Assessment Guidance (TAG) is such a guide. \n\n2. \n\nPURPOSE AND SCOPE \n\nThis TAG contains guidance to advise and inform ONR inspectors in exercising their \nregulatory judgment during assessment activities relating to a dutyholder\u2019s supply \nchain management arrangements.  It aims to provide general advice and guidance to \nONR inspectors on how this aspect of security should be assessed. It does not set out \nhow ONR regulates the dutyholder\u2019s arrangements.  It does not prescribe the detail, \ntargets or methodologies for dutyholders to follow in demonstrating they have \naddressed the SyAPs. It is the dutyholder\u2019s responsibility to determine and describe \nthis detail and for ONR to assess whether the arrangements are adequate.  \n\n3. \n\nRELATIONSHIP TO RELEVANT LEGISLATION \n\nThe term \u2018dutyholder\u2019 mentioned throughout this guide is used to define \u2018responsible \npersons\u2019 on civil nuclear licensed sites and other nuclear premises subject to security \nregulation, a \u2018developer\u2019 carrying out work on a nuclear construction site and approved \ncarriers, as defined in NISR. It is also used to refer to those holding SNI. \n\nNISR defines a \u2018nuclear premises\u2019 and requires \u2018the responsible person\u2019 as defined to \nhave an approved security plan in accordance with Regulation 4. It further defines \napproved carriers and requires them to have an approved Transport Security \nStatement in accordance with Regulation 16. Persons to whom Regulation 22 applies \nare required to protect SNI. ONR considers supply chain management to be an \nimportant component of a dutyholder\u2019s arrangements in demonstrating compliance \nwith relevant legislation. \n\n4. \n\nRELATIONSHIP TO IAEA DOCUMENTATION AND GUIDANCE \n\n4.1 \n\nThe essential elements of a national nuclear security regime are set out in the \nConvention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material (CPPNM) (Reference 3) and \nthe IAEA Nuclear Security Fundamentals (Reference 4). Further guidance is available \nwithin IAEA Technical Guidance and Implementing Guides. \n\n \n \nOFFICIAL  \n \n \n\nReport CNS-TAST-GD-4.1 \nTRIM Ref: 2017/104195 \n\nPage 2 of 15 \n\n\fOffice for Nuclear Regulation  \n \n \n\nOFFICIAL  \n \n \n\n4.3 \n\n5.1 \n\n5.2 \n\n4.2 \n\nFundamental Principle J of the CPPNM refers to quality assurance and states that \u2018a \nquality assurance policy and quality assurance programmes should be established and \nimplemented with a view to providing confidence that specified requirements for all \nactivities important to physical protection are satisfied\u2019. The importance of issues \nrelating to assurance activities are also recognised in the Nuclear Security \nFundamentals, specifically: \n\n\uf0b7 \n\nEssential Element 12: Sustaining a Nuclear Security Regime \u2013 3.12  \n\nh) Routinely performing assurance activities to identify and address issues \nand factors that may affect the capacity to provide adequate nuclear \nsecurity including cyber security at all times. \n\nA more detailed description of the elements is provided in Recommendations level \nguidance, specifically Nuclear Security Series (NSS) 13, Recommendations on \nPhysical Protection of Nuclear Material and Nuclear Facilities (INFCIRC/225/Revision \n5) (Reference 5). \n\n5. \n\nRELATIONSHIP TO NATIONAL POLICY DOCUMENTS \n\nThe SyAPs provide ONR inspectors with a framework for making consistent regulatory \njudgements on the effectiveness of a dutyholder\u2019s security arrangements.  This TAG \nprovides guidance to ONR inspectors when assessing a dutyholder\u2019s submission \ndemonstrating they have effective processes in place to achieve SyDP 4.1 \u2013 \nProcurement and Intelligent Customer Capability, in support of FSyP 4 \u2013 Nuclear \nSupply Chain Management.  The TAG is consistent with other TAGs and associated \nguidance and policy documentation. \n\nThe HMG Security Policy Framework (SPF) (Reference 6) describes the Cabinet \nSecretary\u2019s expectations of how HMG organisations and third parties handling HMG \ninformation and other assets will apply protective security to ensure HMG can function \neffectively, efficiently and securely. The security outcomes and requirements detailed \nin the SPF have been incorporated within the SyAPs. This ensures that dutyholders \nare presented with a coherent set of expectations for the protection of nuclear \npremises, SNI and the employment of appropriate personnel security controls both on \nand off nuclear premises.  \n\n5.3 \n\nThe Classification Policy (Reference 7) indicates those categories of SNI, which \nrequire protection and the level of security classification to be applied. \n\n6. \n\nADVICE TO INSPECTORS \n\n6.1 \n\nThis TAG informs regulatory assessment of Supply Chain Management (SCM) \narrangements and procurement activities for nuclear security related items or services. \nIt establishes ONR\u2019s expectations of the purchaser, as the organisation at the top of \nthe Supply Chain. It considers the procurement of items or services in support of \nconstruction, manufacture, repair, replacement, modification of plant and equipment. \n\n6.2 \n\nThe level of ONR scrutiny is dependent on the security significance of the items or \nservices being procured. This scrutiny might include confirmation of the adequacy of \nthe supplier\u2019s quality management arrangements and/or be part of the manufacturing \n\n \n \nOFFICIAL  \n \n \n\nReport CNS-TAST-GD-4.1 \nTRIM Ref: 2017/104195 \n\nPage 3 of 15 \n\n\fOffice for Nuclear Regulation  \n \n \n\nOFFICIAL  \n \n \n\nor construction inspection activities identified via the supplier\u2019s quality planning \narrangements. \n\nRegulatory Expectations \n\n6.3 \n\nThe regulatory expectation is that dutyholders will describe in the security plan how \nthey achieve effective procurement for items or services for nuclear security and \nmaintain an intelligent customer capability to support nuclear supply chain \nmanagement arrangements. \n\nFSyP 4 - Nuclear Supply \nChain Management \n\nProcurement and Intelligent \nCustomer Capability \n\nSyDP 4.1 \n\nDutyholders should maintain an \u2018Intelligent Customer\u2019 capability for all work carried \nout on their behalf by suppliers that may impact upon nuclear security. \n\n \nIn delivering this principle, dutyholders should: \n\n6.4 \n\n\uf0b7 \n\n\uf0b7 \n\n\uf0b7 \n\n\uf0b7 \n\n\uf0b7 \n\n\uf0b7 \n\nmaintain the capability to recognise work of nuclear security significance to \nensure  it is subject to the appropriate procurement procedures \n\nutilise an effective procurement cycle for work with nuclear security \nsignificance \n\nestablish an effective commercial strategy to enable the delivery of security \nplan requirements \n\nmaintain an intelligent customer capability, which is applied to all work \ncarried out on its behalf by suppliers that may impact upon nuclear security  \n\ndevelop appropriate specifications, with appropriate stakeholder input, to \nsupport the procurement of items or services (including those relating to \ncyber security or information assurance) of nuclear security significance \n\nensure appropriate arrangements are in place for all contracts involving \nsecurity classified information or equipment including that considered SNI in \naccordance with FSyP 7 and its associated delivery principles  \n\nPRINCIPLES AND EXPECTATIONS \n\nONR\u2019s expectations for the principles to be applied to the procurement of goods and \nservices with nuclear security significance is summarised in Diagram 1 below. \n\n \n7. \n\n7.1 \n\n \n\nDiagram 1 \n\n \n \nOFFICIAL  \n \n \n\nReport CNS-TAST-GD-4.1 \nTRIM Ref: 2017/104195 \n\nPage 4 of 15 \n\n\fOffice for Nuclear Regulation  \n \n \n\nOFFICIAL  \n \n \n\n7.2 \n\n8. \n\n8.1 \n\n8.2 \n\nThe dutyholder should also ensure that suppliers protect all tender documentation, \nspecifications and operational requirements in accordance with their security \nclassification.   \n\nESTABLISH AN EFFECTIVE COMMERCIAL AND SUPPLY CHAIN STRATEGY TO \nENABLE DELIVERY OF SUCCESSFUL REQUIREMENTS \n\nThe purchaser\u2019s commercial and/or Supply Chain strategy will influence all \narrangements associated with the procurement of nuclear security related items or \nservices.

The arrangements \nshould be subject to routine review as part of the organisation\u2019s business planning \nprocesses to ensure they remain effective and are proportionate to mitigating the \nidentified risks.  \n\nInspectors should consider: \n\n\uf0b7 \n\n\uf0b7 \n\n\uf0b7 \n\n\uf0b7 \n\n\uf0b7 \n\n\uf0b7 \n\n\uf0b7 \n\nHas the purchaser developed a commercial and/or Supply Chain strategy to \naddress current and future security plan requirements? \n\nDoes the purchaser have effective arrangements to manage their Supply \nChain including a clear strategy and/or policy, and is organised to deliver \nwith roles and responsibilities clearly defined?  \n\nDoes the purchaser have the organisational capabilities to manage supply \nchain delivery? \n\nAre the purchaser\u2019s SCM arrangements subject to routine review to ensure \nthey remain effective in addressing security plan requirements? \n\nHas the Supply Chain strategy been developed cognisant of the learning \navailable from within the organisation, Supply Chain, nuclear and wider \nindustry? \n\nDoes the strategy encourage collaborative working with the Supply Chain, \nsharing common security aims, objectives and success criteria? \n\nDo the purchaser\u2019s make/buy (i.e. outsourcing and in-house provision) \narrangements effectively consider current and future security plan \nrequirements as part of the decision making criteria? \n\n9. \n\nEFFECTIVE PROCUREMENT CYCLE \u2013 SECURITY SPECIFICATION \n\n9.1 \n\n9.2 \n\nThe purchaser should issue security specifications which adequately describe the \nitems or services, meet the security plan/operational requirements and identify the \nassociated level of quality assurance. \n\nEstablishing an effective security specification is of key importance in the procurement \ncycle. An ineffective specification will mean that any contractor in the Supply Chain will \nfind it difficult to deliver the purchaser\u2019s requirements right first time, regardless of their \nown capabilities and processes.  The dutyholder should also have in place a process \nto ensure that the supplier is reliable and can provide the equipment or service in an \nacceptable timeframe.  \n\n9.3 \n\nGiven the importance of the security specification, it is essential that those writing them \nare Suitably Qualified and Experienced (SQEP) to perform the task and their work is \nsubject to the appropriate levels of verification, validation and approval commensurate \n\n \n \nOFFICIAL  \n \n \n\nReport CNS-TAST-GD-4.1 \nTRIM Ref: 2017/104195 \n\nPage 6 of 15 \n\n\fOffice for Nuclear Regulation  \n \n \n\nOFFICIAL  \n \n \n\n9.4 \n\n9.5 \n\n9.8 \n\n9.9 \n\nwith the security significance of the item or service being procured. At the pre-contract \nstage, the purchaser should ensure that prospective suppliers fully understand that the \nitems or services being procured are a principal means of ensuring and maintaining \nnuclear security.  \n\nThe specification should detail any applicable design codes and standards that fully \ndescribe the items or services to be procured together with other generic contractual \nrequirements. This combination of requirements should identify appropriate levels of \nquality assurance requirements to be applied. These should include, where applicable, \nassessment, audit, quality planning, quality control, inspection, surveillance, testing, \nand release or handover of items and should fully detail the records package required \nto be supplied with the item or service.  \n\nFor items or services which are the principal means of ensuring nuclear security, \nadditional assurance and inspection arrangements may be required, which go beyond \nbasic compliance with established design codes and standards. ONR may wish to \nassess the technical specification used as the basis for procurement prior to the \nprocurement action, taking into account any additional requirements.  \n\n9.6 \n\nThroughout the design process, appropriate assurance activities should be undertaken \nto ensure that the design meets the requirements of the purchaser and applicable \ncodes or standards in addition to any regulatory expectations.  \n\n9.7  Where technical specifications are prepared for nuclear security significant items or \n\nservices by contractors on behalf of the purchaser, these should be reviewed by staff \nfrom the purchaser\u2019s organisation who are competent to confirm that the specifications \nproperly reflect the design intent, meet any design codes and standards and as such \nmeet security plan requirements. This review should be carried out before contract \nplacement.  \n\nOn receipt of the purchase order, the supplier should carry out a review of the contract \ndocumentation to ensure it can fulfil all the technical, procedural and commercial \nrequirements of the contract. For complex and high capital value security equipment, \ndiscussions between the supplier (and sub-suppliers) and purchaser should normally \nhave covered these aspects prior to contract placement. The supplier should advise \nthe purchaser of any changes to its (or its sub-suppliers) ability to fulfil the contract as \nsuch changes arise.  \n\nThe purchaser should operate a change control process to ensure that any changes to \nspecification, design or contract are properly controlled and authorised, and the \nimplications for nuclear security and the manufacturing/delivery processes, including \nchanges to documentation (particularly process quality related, e.g. quality plans), are \nfully considered prior to the implementation of the change. Where these changes \nimpact on the security plan, it may require further assessment by ONR. \n\n \n\nInspectors should consider: \n\n\uf0b7 \n\nDo specifications reflect the design intent, design codes and standards, and \nmeet security plan requirements?  \n\n \n \nOFFICIAL  \n \n \n\nReport CNS-TAST-GD-4.1 \nTRIM Ref: 2017/104195 \n\nPage 7 of 15 \n\n\fOffice for Nuclear Regulation  \n \n \n\nOFFICIAL  \n \n \n\n\uf0b7 \n\n\uf0b7 \n\n\uf0b7 \n\n\uf0b7 \n\n\uf0b7 \n\n\uf0b7 \n\n\uf0b7 \n\nAre specifications prepared by contractors reviewed by competent staff from \nthe purchaser\u2019s organisation?  \n\nAre appropriate levels of quality assurance applied to the procurement of \nitems or services significant to nuclear security?  \n\nDo the purchaser\u2019s specification and assurance arrangements address any \nspecific regulatory requirements?  \n\nDo suppliers fully understand that the items or services being procured are a \nmeans of ensuring and maintaining nuclear security, and their significance? \n\nAre variations to specification, design or contract properly conceived, \ncommunicated, implemented and assessed for nuclear security implications \nand authorised by SQEP staff? \n\nDo suppliers notify the purchaser of any proposed changes and that they are \nproperly assessed and authorised by the purchaser? \n\nAre supplier documents (e.g. quality plans and manufacturing instructions) \nre-approved before a change is implemented?  \n\n10. \n\nEFFECTIVE PROCUREMENT CYCLE \u2013 DEVIATIONS FROM SPECIFIED \nREQUIREMENTS \n\n10.1  The purchaser should ensure that suppliers identify and categorise any deviations from  \n\nspecified requirements, referring to the dutyholder\u2019s Design Authority (DA \u2013 as defined \nin Security TAG 1.2) for assessment.

Deviations can be associated with an \nitem or service or be the result of the inadequate implementation of the approved \nprocess.  \n\n10.3  The identification, reporting and resolution of deviations should not be seen as \n\nnegative, but as an indication that the achievement of the purchaser\u2019s requirements is \nof prime importance. The control of any deviation from the technical specification is \nfundamental to the achievement of quality and therefore the integrity of the item.  \n\n10.4  All organisations within the Supply Chain should, as part of their quality management \narrangements, operate consistent arrangements, overseen by the purchaser, for the \ncategorisation and disposition of deviations.  \n\n10.5  Purchasers at each level of the Supply Chain should ensure their suppliers have \nadequate arrangements for the identification, categorisation and management of \ndeviations for items or services. These should include obtaining the approval of the \npurchaser, or dutyholder\u2019s DA, for the deviation in the form of a concession or \nprocedure for re-work. They should inform the ultimate purchaser and potentially ONR \n(via the purchaser at the head of the Supply Chain) for deviations that are significant to \nnuclear security.  \n\n \n \nOFFICIAL  \n \n \n\nReport CNS-TAST-GD-4.1 \nTRIM Ref: 2017/104195 \n\nPage 8 of 15 \n\n\fOffice for Nuclear Regulation  \n \n \n\nOFFICIAL  \n \n \n\n10.6  Technical Queries (TQs) are slightly different to a non-conformance. For the former, \n\nthe supplier is asking a question for approval prior to doing the work and for the latter, \nthe work has started and is found to be either outside the acceptance criteria for the \nproduct, or the process has not been implemented as approved. TQs are raised during \nthe work planning stage and help inform or clarify the contract requirements. Once the \npurchaser agrees to a TQ that requires a change in the design or other process, then \nthe purchaser should track the modification to completion with contract changes \nthrough formal change control being communicated to the supplier if applicable. The \npurchaser\u2019s arrangements should ensure that both types of deviation from the \noriginally specified requirements are appropriately controlled and documented.  \n\n10.7  There should be an audit trail in work control documents for all approved deviations as \n\nwell as systematic overarching deviation tracking logs that show the status of each \ndeviation. Approved deviations should be used to update drawings to reflect \u2018as built\u2019 \nstatus to aid configuration control for future modifications.  \n\nInspectors should consider: \n\n\uf0b7 \n\n\uf0b7 \n\n\uf0b7 \n\nAre deviations identified, characterised and formally sanctioned by \ncompetent persons with the appropriate delegated authority? \n\nDo suppliers bring all deviations of nuclear security significance to the \nattention of the purchaser, dutyholder\u2019s DA and ONR if appropriate, via the \npurchaser at the head of the Supply Chain? \n\nIs there a demonstrable audit trail for all approved deviations from the work \ncontrol document to logs showing the status of each deviation raised, \napproved, rejected or reworked with links to required document changes? \n\n11. \n\nEFFECTIVE PROCUREMENT CYCLE \u2013 COUNTERFEIT FRAUDULENT AND \nSUSPECT ITEMS (CFSI) \n\n11.1  The purchaser should have arrangements to mitigate the risks of Counterfeit, \n\nFraudulent and Suspect Items (CFSI) entering their Supply Chain.  \n\n11.2  There should be recognition throughout all levels of the Supply Chain that there are \n\nparties who might wish to substitute CFSI for genuine items or services for commercial \ngain or with malicious intent.

MAINTAINING AN INTELLIGENT CUSTOMER CAPABILITY \n\n13.1  The concept of intelligent customer (IC) for safety is defined by the IAEA as follows: \n\n\u2018As an intelligent customer, in the context of nuclear safety, the management of \nthe facility should know what is required, should fully understand the need for a \ncontractor's services, should specify requirements, should supervise the work \nand should technically review the output before, during and after implementation. \nThe concept of intelligent customer relates to the attributes of an organisation \nrather than the capabilities of individual post holders\u2019. \n\n  \n\nThis equally applies to nuclear security and a dutyholder\u2019s intelligent customer \ncapability for security will be a subset of its core capability. \n\n13.2  The primary responsibility for the security of a nuclear premises rests with the \n\ndutyholder. The dutyholder should be able to demonstrate sufficient knowledge of the \nplant design and security plan for all plant and operations on the site. The dutyholder \nmust be in control of activities on its site, understand the hazards associated with its \nactivities and how to control them, and have sufficient competent resource within its \norganisation to act as an \u2018Intelligent Customer\u2019 for any work it commissions externally.  \n\n13.3 \n\nIn the context of effective SCM the dutyholder should maintain an \u2018Intelligent \nCustomer\u2019 capability to know what is needed, to fully understand the need for a \ncontractor\u2019s services, at any level of the Supply Chain, specify requirements, supervise \nwork and technically review the output before, during and after implementation.  \n\n13.4  ONR\u2019s regulatory expectations of a dutyholder\u2019s arrangements for the use of \n\ncontractors, for retaining control of nuclear security and for discharging its other duties \nare summarised as follows.

This document contains Fundamental Security \nPrinciples (FSyPs) that dutyholders must demonstrate have been fully taken into \naccount in developing their security arrangements to meet relevant legal obligations. \nThe security regime for meeting these principles is described in security plans \nprepared by the dutyholders, which are approved by ONR under the Nuclear Industries \nSecurity Regulations (NISR) 2003 (Reference 1).  \n\nThe term \u2018security plan\u2019 is used to cover all dutyholder submissions such as nuclear \nsite security plans, temporary security plans and transport security statements. NISR \nRegulation 22 dutyholders may also use the SyAPs as the basis for Cyber Security \nand Information Assurance documentation that helps them demonstrate ongoing legal \ncompliance for the protection of Sensitive Nuclear Information (SNI). The SyAPs are \nsupported by a suite of guides to assist ONR inspectors in their assessment and \ninspection work, and in making regulatory judgements and decisions.  This Technical \nAssessment Guidance (TAG) is such a guide. \n\n2. \n\nPURPOSE AND SCOPE \n\nThis TAG contains guidance to advise and inform ONR inspectors in exercising their \nregulatory judgment during assessment activities relating to a dutyholder\u2019s \narrangements to ensure their security systems have appropriate levels of reliability and \nresilience. It aims to provide general advice and guidance to ONR inspectors on how \nthis aspect of security should be assessed. It does not set out how ONR regulates the \ndutyholder\u2019s arrangements.  It does not prescribe the methodologies for dutyholders to \nfollow in demonstrating they have addressed the SyAPs. It is the dutyholder\u2019s \nresponsibility to determine and describe this detail and for ONR to assess whether the \narrangements are adequate.  \n\n3. \n\nRELATIONSHIP TO LEGISLATION \n\nThe term \u2018dutyholder\u2019 mentioned throughout this guide is used to define \u2018responsible \npersons\u2019 on civil nuclear licensed sites and other nuclear premises subject to security \nregulation, a \u2018developer\u2019 carrying out work on a nuclear construction site and approved \ncarriers, as defined in NISR. It is also used to refer to those holding SNI.  \n\nNISR defines a \u2018nuclear premises\u2019 and requires \u2018the responsible person\u2019 as defined to \nhave an approved security plan in accordance with Regulation 4. It further defines \napproved carriers and requires them to have an approved Transport Security \nStatement in accordance with Regulation 16. Persons to whom Regulation 22 applies \nare required to protect SNI. ONR considers reliability, resilience and sustainability to \nbe important components of a dutyholder\u2019s arrangements in demonstrating compliance \nwith relevant legislation.   \n\n4. \n\nRELATIONSHIP TO IAEA DOCUMENTATION AND GUIDANCE \n\n4.1 \n\nThe essential elements of a national nuclear security regime are set out in the \nConvention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material (CPPNM) (Reference 4) and \nthe IAEA Nuclear Security Fundamentals (Reference 3). Further guidance is available \nwithin IAEA Technical Guidance and Implementing Guides. \n\n4.2 \n\nFundamental Principle J of the CPPNM refers to quality assurance and states that a \nquality assurance policy and quality assurance programmes should be established and \n\nReport CNS-TAST-GD-5.1 \nTRIM Ref: 2017/100306 \n\nPage 2 of 10 \n\n \nOFFICIAL \n \n\n\fOffice for Nuclear Regulation  \n \n \n\nOFFICIAL \n \n \n\nimplemented with a view to providing confidence that specified requirements for all \nactivities important to physical protection are satisfied. The importance of issues \nrelating to quality assurance is also recognised in the Nuclear Security Fundamentals, \nspecifically: \n\n\uf0b7 \n\nEssential Element 12: Sustaining a Nuclear Security Regime \u2013 3.12 A \nnuclear security regime ensures that each competent authority and \nauthorised person and other organisations with nuclear security \nresponsibilities contribute to the sustainability of the regime by: \n\no \n\no \n\no \n\nAllocating sufficient human, financial and technical resources to carry \nout the organisation\u2019s nuclear security responsibilities on a continuing \nbasis using a risk-informed approach \n\nRoutinely conducting maintenance, training and evaluation to ensure \nthe effectiveness of the nuclear security systems \n\nRoutinely performing assurance activities to identify and address \nissues and factors that may affect the capacity to provide adequate \nnuclear security, including cyber security, at all times  \n\n4.3 \n\n5.1 \n\n5.2 \n\nA more detailed description of the quality assurance is provided in Recommendations \nlevel guidance, specifically Nuclear Security Series (NSS) 13, Recommendations on \nPhysical Protection of Nuclear Material and Nuclear Facilities (INFCIRC/225/Revision \n5) (Reference 2). This document states \u201cThe quality assurance policy and \nprogramme(s) for physical protection should ensure that a physical protection system \nis designed, implemented, operated and maintained in a condition capable of \neffectively responding to the threat assessment or design basis threat and that it meets \nthe State\u2019s regulations, including its prescriptive and/or performance based \nrequirements.\u201d \n\n5. \n\nRELATIONSHIP TO NATIONAL POLICY DOCUMENTS \n\nThe SyAPs provide ONR inspectors with a framework for making consistent regulatory \njudgements on the effectiveness of a dutyholder\u2019s security arrangements.  This TAG \nprovides guidance to ONR inspectors when assessing a dutyholder\u2019s submission \ndemonstrating they have effective processes in place to achieve SyDP 5.1 \u2013 Reliability \nand Resilience, in support of FSyP 5 \u2013 Reliability, Resilience and Sustainability.  The \nTAG is consistent with other TAGs and associated guidance and policy \ndocumentation. \n\nThe HMG Security Policy Framework (SPF) (Reference 5) describes the Cabinet \nSecretary\u2019s expectations of how HMG organisations and third parties handling HMG \ninformation and other assets will apply protective security to ensure HMG can function \neffectively, efficiently and securely. The security outcomes and requirements detailed \nin the SPF have been incorporated within the SyAPs. This ensures that dutyholders \nare presented with a coherent set of expectations for the protection of nuclear \npremises, SNI and the employment of appropriate personnel security controls both on \nand off nuclear premises. \n\n5.3 \n\nThe Classification Policy (Reference 6) indicates those categories of SNI, which \nrequire protection and the level of security classification to be applied. \n\n \n\nReport CNS-TAST-GD-5.1 \nTRIM Ref: 2017/100306 \n\n \nOFFICIAL \n \n\nPage 3 of 10 \n\n\fOffice for Nuclear Regulation  \n \n \n\nOFFICIAL \n \n \n\n6. \n\nADVICE TO INSPECTORS \n\n \n\n \n\n6.1 \n\n6.2 \n\n6.3 \n\n6.4 \n\nIt is particularly important to ensure, so far as possible, that the security system is \ncapable of performing its function with an adequate level of reliability. This objective \nmay be achieved by the adoption of a number of different provisions, together with the \nuse of techniques to demonstrate the adequacy of the specified measures. The \nreliability of plant and systems to provide the security effect should be demonstrated by \nthe dutyholder to be consistent with the risks associated with the loss of this capability. \nThis should be informed by the Category of the security function and the Classification \nof the security structure, system or component (SSC) concerned.  \n\nThe security system design should incorporate an appropriate level of redundancy to \nreduce the effects of random failure, and diversity and segregation to reduce the \neffects of common cause failure and malicious actions. This should take account of the \nsite or facility the system is protecting and its vulnerability to threats described in the \nNuclear Industries Malicious Capabilities Planning Assumptions document (Reference \n8). \n\nIn assessing the fitness for purpose of the security system, and particularly the ability \nto deliver a particular effect, a number of issues relating to redundancy and diverse \nprovisions should be considered. Security plans should clearly identify the security \nfunction of all SSCs so that this assessment can be carried out. \n\nRegulatory Expectation \n\nThere is a regulatory expectation that dutyholders demonstrate in the security plan \nhow they ensure that the design and operation of the security system delivers \nappropriate levels of redundancy, diversity and segregation. Dutyholders should \nprovide sufficient resources (including personnel) to inform the design, to maintain and \nto restore nuclear security SSCs, thus building resilience to enable an appropriate and \neffective incident response, and a recovery programme that reflects the risk of any loss \nof service. Essential services critical to the correct functioning of the security system \nshould be given the same priority as the system itself and as such are required to have \nappropriate levels of reliability and resilience. \n\nFSYP 4 - Reliability, \nResilience and \nSustainability \n\nReliability and Resilience \n\nSyDP 5.1 \n\nSecurity structures, systems and components should be appropriately qualified, with \ndesign incorporating reliability and resilience through \u2018failsecure\u2019, redundancy, \ndiversity and segregation. There should also be sufficient resources available and \ncontingency arrangements developed to ensure continuity of security provision.  \n\n7. \n\nELEMENTS OF SYSTEM RESILIENCE \n\nRedundancy \n\n7.1 \n\nRedundancy is frequently defined as the provision of more than the minimum number \nof equipment items required to perform a specific security function. Such redundancy \nallows a specified security function to be delivered when one or more items (but not all) \n\nReport CNS-TAST-GD-5.1 \nTRIM Ref: 2017/100306 \n\nPage 4 of 10 \n\n \nOFFICIAL \n \n\n\fOffice for Nuclear Regulation  \n \n \n\n7.2 \n\n7.3 \n\nOFFICIAL \n \n \nare unavailable, due to a variety of unspecified potential failure mechanisms or \nmaintenance (e.g. identified faults or hazards).  \n\nExperience dictates there are deterministic and probabilistic arguments to justify the \nprovision of redundancy in SSCs. A design which is considered acceptable will display \nadequate levels of system redundancy to ensure it is fit for purpose and should \nperform the required security function. These characteristics will include final \nprovisions to satisfy the deterministic and probabilistic requirements of any potential \ndesign for SSCs important to security.  \n\nDependent Failure \n\nA possible threat to security system resilience is that posed by dependent failure. \nThese have the potential to prevent the performance of a required security function \nthrough simultaneous loss of redundant provisions. Particular illustrations of this type \nof failure are common-cause failures (CCF).The inspector should be satisfied that the \nrisk from dependent failures has been reduced to a level which is acceptable within the \nlimits set by design requirements. It is important to note that reliability does not \nnecessarily increase indefinitely in proportion to levels of redundancy, and this is \nprimarily due to common origin or common cause effects. This type of failure is often \nreferred to either as CCF or a common mode failure (CMF). A CCF is a dependent \nfailure event where approximately simultaneous multiple failures result from a single \nshared cause (e.g. fire). A CMF is a common cause event where the multiple \nequipment items fail in the same mode.  \n\n7.4  Multiple failures can occur due to common weaknesses or dependencies shared by \ncomponents. Such failures can cause failure of all redundant components in a single \nsecurity system or failure of components in more than one system. Dependent failures \ncan considerably reduce the reliability of the security systems relative to that expected \nof random failures acting isolation.  \n\n7.5 \n\nThe main types of dependencies which could cause potential loss of a security function \nare described below. \n\n\uf0b7 \n\n\uf0b7 \n\n\uf0b7 \n\n\uf0b7 \n\nFunctional  dependencies,  which  arise  from  shared  or  common  functional \nfeatures;  such  as  a  common  electrical  power  source,  common  wiring  or  a \nshared communication node.  \n\nSpatial  dependencies,  which  arise  from  physical  features  shared  by \ncomponents  located  in  a  common  location;  such  as  common  radiation  or \nchemical  conditions,  a  common  environment  and  common  support \nstructures,  and  vulnerability to  leaks  of  dangerous  fluids  (high temperature, \ncorrosive or toxic).  \n\nInherent dependencies, which arise from shared characteristics; such as a \ncommon  principle  of  operation  or  technical  feature  such  as  electrical \noverload.  \n\nHuman  error  related  dependencies,  which  arise  from  human  errors \naffecting some shared or common human process; such as human error in \ndesign  or  manufacture,  or  operating  staff  error  during  operation  and \nmaintenance. \n\nReport CNS-TAST-GD-5.1 \nTRIM Ref: 2017/100306 \n\nPage 5 of 10 \n\n \nOFFICIAL \n \n\n\fOffice for Nuclear Regulation  \n \n \n\nOFFICIAL \n \n \n\n7.6 \n\nTo provide protection against dependent failures, the inspector should seek \nconfirmation that the dutyholder has identified and, where necessary and practicable, \nimplemented measures in design, construction and operation to eliminate them or \nreduce their potential effect. Examples of such measures are:  \n\n\uf0b7 \n\n\uf0b7 \n\n\uf0b7 \n\n\uf0b7 \n\nthe provision of segregation to eliminate spatial dependencies; \n\nthe avoidance of functional dependencies by segregation of SSCs important \nto security and their support services; \n\nthe provision of alternative and independent equipment to eliminate undue \nreliance on any single system. The purpose of this element of the approach \nis to provide protection against any 'hidden failure dependencies' that may \nnot be identified; and \n\napproaches and procedures should be implemented to minimise the \npossibility of failure dependencies arising during design, manufacture, \nconstruction and operation, including dependencies due to operator and \nother human error. \n\nDiversity \n\n7.7  Where a component of the security system is at potential risk from common cause \nfailures, one means of reducing the susceptibility is to employ diverse provisions in \nseparate redundant trains or systems. For example, the detect function over a given \narea could be delivered by both fixed-line and pan-tilt-zoom closed circuit television \npowered by segregated electricity supplies and a dual perimeter intruder detection \nsystem utilising complementary technologies (for example infrared and microphonic \ntechnologies). A dutyholder should consider appropriate measures to include diversity \nwithin the components of the system which is designed to deliver an individual effect \nand/or across the security systems in its entirety. Engineering diversity is defined as \nthe provision of dissimilar means of achieving the same objective; e.g. the use of \nfeatures which differ in the physical means of achieving a specific objective or use of \ndifferent equipment made by different manufacturers.  \n\n7.8 \n\n7.9 \n\n7.10 \n\nDiversity provides one means of protection against some dependent failure \nmechanisms, by removing common features which may lead to failure dependencies. \nDiversity particularly provides protection against inherent dependencies and human \nerror related dependencies.  \n\nThe possibility of the physical co-location or the functional support of diverse systems \nleading to dependencies which defeat the objective of providing diversity, should be \naddressed in the layout and functional design of the security system where \nappropriate. \n\nSegregation \n\nIn a resilient security system and despite diverse provisions, the threat of common \ncause failures from hazards such as fire or hostile intent may be reduced by system \nsegregation. This is the separation of components by distance or physical barriers, a \nparticular example being provision of principal fire barriers to delineate individual fire \nzones; they may also serve as barriers to other hazards such as blast. Appropriate \nlevels of segregation should be present in a dutyholder\u2019s provisions in order to \n\nReport CNS-TAST-GD-5.1 \nTRIM Ref: 2017/100306 \n\nPage 6 of 10 \n\n \nOFFICIAL \n \n\n\fOffice for Nuclear Regulation  \n \n \n\nOFFICIAL \n \n \n\nmaximise the likelihood that a security function will be performed, despite the \noccurrence of faults and hazards, possibly in combination.   \n\n7.11  Equipment segregation is the separation of redundant and/or diverse components by \ndistance or by barriers in order to prevent all (or sufficient to enable system failure) of \nthe components being damaged, particularly in the event of common hazards or \nmalicious action. Segregation is provided in the design to ensure internal hazards, \nsuch as fire and certain external threats do not damage separate chains of security \nequipment to the extent that its functional reliability is unacceptably reduced. The most \nstraightforward manner in which segregation can be achieved is through distance and \navoidance of co-locating components. \n\nSystem Independence \n\n7.12  Security systems may be subject to spurious operation in addition to operational \nfailures. These can arise because a given security system component does not \npossess a sufficient level of independence from other separate systems. Measures \nneed to be employed by the dutyholder to ensure that, wherever possible, security \nsystem components are not adversely affected by the spurious operation or failure of \nother systems, especially through any potential for hidden dependency (for example, \nby having a single system responsible for fire and security response). This is best \nachieved by designing in both functional and physical isolation. \n\n8. \n\nSUITABLY QUALIFIED AND EXPERIENCED PERSONNEL \n\n8.1 \n\nThe dutyholder\u2019s security organisation should possess adequate Suitably Qualified and \nExperienced (SQEP) personnel to support security systems. This includes having \nsufficient personnel with the necessary competences and knowledge to provide \nresilience and maintain the capability to manage, operate, maintain and repair security \nsystems at all times.  \n\n9. \n\nESSENTIAL SERVICES AND THE SECURITY SYSTEM \n\nWhere essential services (such as computer based security systems) are necessary to \nsupport the functioning of a Physical Protection System (PPS), then these services \nshould be sufficiently resilient and secure to ensure that their loss or interruption does \nnot adversely affect the ability of the PPS to achieve the required outcome as defined \nin SyAPs Annexes C and D. \n\n Inspectors should consider: \n\n\uf0b7  Has reliability, resilience and sustainability been considered throughout the \ndesign stage for any new facility or security system and incorporated within \nrelevant operational requirements? \n\n\uf0b7  Are requirements for security systems regularly reassessed in conjunction with \n\nall stakeholders? \n\n\uf0b7  Are there sufficient SQEP and other resources to manage, operate, maintain \n\nand repair the security system? \n\n\uf0b7  Does the design and operation of the security system display appropriate levels \n\nof redundancy, diversity and segregation? \n\nReport CNS-TAST-GD-5.1 \nTRIM Ref: 2017/100306 \n\nPage 7 of 10 \n\n \nOFFICIAL \n \n\n\fOffice for Nuclear Regulation  \n \n \n\nOFFICIAL \n \n \n\n\uf0b7  Do essential services (such as power) necessary for the correct functioning of \nthe security system have the appropriate levels of security, reliability and \nresilience? \n\n\uf0b7  Have potential dependencies and/or vulnerabilities of the security system been \n\nidentified and mitigated? \n\n\uf0b7  Do security systems \u2018fail secure\u2019 and if they do not, are security requirements \n\nappropriately balanced against safety requirements and are adequate \ncompensatory security measures available? \n\n\uf0b7  Does the dutyholder demonstrate the ability to learn from experience of \n\nmaintaining the security system? \n\n\uf0b7 \n\nIs there a process of continuous improvement in place in relation to the security \nsystem\u2019s reliability, resilience and sustainability? \n\n\uf0b7  Are appropriate quality performance and assurance mechanisms applied to \n\nsecurity systems? \n\n\uf0b7 \n\nIs the response to the failure or loss of part of or all of a SSC regularly \nexercised or rehearsed? \n\n \n\n \n\nReport CNS-TAST-GD-5.1 \nTRIM Ref: 2017/100306 \n\nPage 8 of 10 \n\n \nOFFICIAL \n \n\n\fOffice for Nuclear Regulation  \n \n \n\n10. \n\nREFERENCES \n\nOFFICIAL \n \n \n\n1. \n \n2. \n\n \n3. \n\n \n4. \n\n \n5. \n\n \n6. \n \n7. \n \n8. \n\nNuclear Industries Security Regulations 2003.

This document contains Fundamental Security \nPrinciples (FSyPs) that dutyholders must demonstrate have been fully taken into \naccount in developing their security arrangements to meet relevant legal obligations. \nThe security regime for meeting these principles is described in security plans \nprepared by the dutyholders, which are approved by ONR under the Nuclear Industries \nSecurity Regulations (NISR) 2003 (Reference 2). \n\nThe term \u2018security plan\u2019 is used to cover all dutyholder submissions such as nuclear \nsite security plans, temporary security plans and transport security statements. NISR \nRegulation 22 dutyholders may also use the SyAPs as the basis for Cyber Security \nand Information Assurance (CS&IA) documentation that helps them demonstrate \nongoing legal compliance for the protection of Sensitive Nuclear Information (SNI). The \nSyAPs are supported by a suite of guides to assist ONR inspectors in their \nassessment and inspection work, and in making regulatory judgements and decisions.  \nThis Technical Assessment Guidance (TAG) is such a guide. \n\n2. \n\nPURPOSE AND SCOPE \n\nThis TAG contains guidance to advise and inform ONR inspectors in exercising their \nregulatory judgment during assessment activities relating to a dutyholder\u2019s supply \nchain management arrangements.  It aims to provide general advice and guidance to \nONR inspectors on how this aspect of security should be assessed. It does not set out \nhow ONR regulates the dutyholder\u2019s arrangements.  It does not prescribe the detail, \ntargets or methodologies for dutyholders to follow in demonstrating they have \naddressed the SyAPs. It is the dutyholder\u2019s responsibility to determine and describe \nthis detail and for ONR to assess whether the arrangements are adequate.   \n\n3. \n\nRELATIONSHIP TO RELEVANT LEGISLATION \n\nThe term \u2018dutyholder\u2019 mentioned throughout this guide is used to define \u2018responsible \npersons\u2019 on civil nuclear licensed sites and other nuclear premises subject to security \nregulation, a \u2018developer\u2019 carrying out work on a nuclear construction site and approved \ncarriers, as defined in NISR. It is also used to refer to those holding SNI. \n\nNISR defines a \u2018nuclear premises\u2019 and requires \u2018the responsible person\u2019 as defined to \nhave an approved security plan in accordance with Regulation 4. It further defines \napproved carriers and requires them to have an approved Transport Security \nStatement in accordance with Regulation 16. Persons to whom Regulation 22 applies \nare required to protect SNI. ONR considers supply chain management to be an \nimportant component of a dutyholder\u2019s arrangements in demonstrating compliance \nwith relevant legislation. \n\n4. \n\nRELATIONSHIP TO IAEA DOCUMENTATION AND GUIDANCE \n\n4.1 \n\nThe essential elements of a national nuclear security regime are set out in the \nConvention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material (CPPNM) (Reference 3) and \nthe IAEA Nuclear Security Fundamentals (Reference 4). Further guidance is available \nwithin IAEA Technical Guidance and Implementing Guides. \n\nReport CNS-TAST-GD-4.2 \nTRIM Ref: 2017/106056 \n\nPage 2 of 9 \n\n \nOFFICIAL  \n \n \n\n\fOffice for Nuclear Regulation  \n \n \n\nOFFICIAL  \n \n \n\n4.3 \n\n5.1 \n\n5.2 \n\n4.2 \n\nFundamental Principle J of the CPPNM refers to quality assurance and states that \u2018a \nquality assurance policy and quality assurance programmes should be established and \nimplemented with a view to providing confidence that specified requirements for all \nactivities important to physical protection are satisfied\u2019. The importance of issues \nrelating to assurance activities are also recognised in the Nuclear Security \nFundamentals, specifically: \n\n\uf0b7 \n\nEssential Element 12: Sustaining a Nuclear Security Regime \u2013 3.12  \n\nh) Routinely performing assurance activities to identify and address issues \nand factors that may affect the capacity to provide adequate nuclear \nsecurity including cyber security at all times. \n\nA more detailed description of the elements is provided in Recommendations level \nguidance, specifically Nuclear Security Series (NSS) 13, Recommendations on \nPhysical Protection of Nuclear Material and Nuclear Facilities (INFCIRC/225/Revision \n5) (Reference 5). \n\n5. \n\nRELATIONSHIP TO NATIONAL POLICY DOCUMENTS \n\nThe SyAPs provide ONR inspectors with a framework for making consistent regulatory \njudgements on the effectiveness of a dutyholder\u2019s security arrangements.  This TAG \nprovides guidance to ONR inspectors when assessing a dutyholder\u2019s submission \ndemonstrating they have effective processes in place to achieve SyDP 4.2 \u2013 Supplier \nCapability, in support of FSyP 4 \u2013 Nuclear Supply Chain Management.  The TAG is \nconsistent with other TAGs and associated guidance and policy documentation. \n\nThe HMG Security Policy Framework (SPF) (Reference 6) describes the Cabinet \nSecretary\u2019s expectations of how HMG organisations and third parties handling HMG \ninformation and other assets will apply protective security to ensure HMG can function \neffectively, efficiently and securely. The security outcomes and requirements detailed \nin the SPF have been incorporated within the SyAPs. This ensures that dutyholders \nare presented with a coherent set of expectations for the protection of nuclear \npremises, SNI and the employment of appropriate personnel security controls both on \nand off nuclear premises. \n\n5.3 \n\nThe Classification Policy (Reference 7) indicates those categories of SNI, which \nrequire protection and the level of security classification to be applied. \n\n6. \n\nADVICE TO INSPECTORS \n\n6.1 \n\nThis TAG informs regulatory assessment of Supply Chain Management (SCM) \narrangements with a particular focus on the supplier\u2019s capability. It should be read \ntogether with the Safety TAG NS-TAST-GD 049 Rev 5 \u2018Licensee Core and Intelligent \nCustomer Capabilities\u2019.  That TAG defines key terms: \u2018core capability\u2019, \u2018contractor\u2019 and \n\u2018intelligent customer\u2019.   The TAG also relates the use of contractors to several Licence \nConditions.   \n\nRegulatory Expectations \n\n6.2 \n\nThe regulatory expectation is that dutyholders will describe in the security plan how \nthey seek assurance of supplier capability to support effective nuclear supply chain \nmanagement arrangements. \n\nReport CNS-TAST-GD-4.2 \nTRIM Ref: 2017/106056 \n\nPage 3 of 9 \n\n \nOFFICIAL  \n \n \n\n\fOffice for Nuclear Regulation  \n \n \n\nOFFICIAL  \n \n \n\n6.3 \n\n6.4 \n\n7.1 \n\n7.2 \n\n7.3 \n\nFSyP 4 - Nuclear Supply \nChain Management \n\nSupplier Capability \n\nSyDP 4.2 \n\nFor work with nuclear security significance, dutyholders should evaluate and confirm that \nsuppliers have the organisational and technical capability, capacity and culture to deliver \nitems or services to the specification prior to placing any contract. \n\n \nThe regulatory expectation from dutyholders is that they will evaluate and confirm \nsuppliers have the organisational and technical capability, capacity and culture to \ndeliver items or services to the specification prior to placing any contract for items or \nservices identified as being of nuclear security significance. This expectation is in \naddition to the normal personnel security screening necessary for any contractor to \ngain access to a site or operation.  That process aims to counter the \u2018insider threat\u2019 \nand CPNI has produced a number of good practice guides on how this might be \nmitigated, with specific reference to contractors.    \n\nThe regulatory expectation from dutyholders is that they will ensure suppliers have \nquality management arrangements which are appropriate and consistent with the \nsecurity significance of the procured items or services. In most cases dutyholders will \nuse established contractors with a good track record.  Such contractors are likely to \nhave the appropriate accreditations and associations.  For example: Security Industry \nAssociation\u2019s Approved Contractor Scheme, BS EN ISO 9001 Quality Management \nSystems, membership of the Security Institute and related codes of practice and British \nStandards.   \n\nFor work with nuclear security significance, the purchaser should evaluate and confirm \nthat suppliers have the organisational and technical capability, capacity and culture to \ndeliver items or services to specification, prior to placing any contract.  \n\nSuppliers should be selected by the purchaser after evaluation against pre-defined \ncriteria appropriate to the contract. The criteria will test the supplier\u2019s ability to meet the \nspecified intent and should include information from the supplier that provides objective \nevidence of their capability and capacity to deliver the required item or service. The \ncriteria for selection should be appropriately weighted to evaluate the supplier\u2019s ability \nto meet the required security performance (e.g. protection of SNI) of the contract. \n\nPurchasers are expected to ensure that the supply chain has the organisational and \ntechnical capability to deliver items or services in line with their requirements. \nSuppliers\u2019 organisational arrangements should include documented management \nsystem arrangements appropriate to the items or services being supplied. These \nsystems should be implemented and be able to meet the requirements of any relevant \nnational or international management system standard for quality, environment and \nsecurity management. An evaluation of a potential supplier should include the potential \nsupplier\u2019s nuclear security culture, ensuring that the organisation and its leaders \nunderstand, or have the potential to understand, the importance of nuclear security \nand the contribution of any high-risk item or service they may supply to achieving the \npurchaser\u2019s security plan requirements. \n\n7. \n\nSUPPLY CHAIN ORGANISATION AND TECHNICAL CAPABILITY \n\n7.4 \n\nAs part of the supplier selection process, the purchaser should confirm that suppliers \nhave adequate oversight and assurance arrangements for their own suppliers.

The judgement on competency should be based on qualifications, training \nand experience using the supplier organisation\u2019s own criteria and any applicable \ndesign code requirements for selection, employment and training of employees.

The \nuse of quality plans, developed by the supplier and agreed with the purchaser, is \nessential to ensure that items are fabricated, manufactured, erected, tested and \ninspected in a planned and controlled manner, and that the required levels of integrity \nare achieved and can be demonstrated within the required record/evidence package. \n\nQuality Plans allow the purchaser to check in advance that the supplier has fully \nunderstood the detailed requirements of the technical specification, and that the \nsupplier has the necessary assurance activities to deliver items that will meet the \ntechnical specification and applicable codes and standards. Quality Plans also allow \nthe purchaser, second party (supplier), independent third party inspection personnel, \nand, in some instances, ONR, to insert inspection points, witness points, review points \nor hold points into the manufacturing sequence. \n\nQuality Plans should include the full sequence of steps to deliver the item or service \nand details of hold point release. These need to be available for review by involved \nparties before work commences and in sufficient time to allow these parties to review \nand annotate them with hold, inspection, witness and review points and/or to question \nthe sequence or referenced documents. \n\nQuality Plans, in identifying the sequence of activities required to satisfy the \nrequirements of the contract, should reference process or fabrication instructions, \ntests, inspections and clearly identify the records required to be generated and \nprovided to the purchaser. They should enable each stage of work to be signed for as \nbeing complete and also on the completion of work covered by each element of the \nplan. Proposed changes to quality plans before and during work commencement \nshould be formally controlled and agreed by all the inspecting parties. \n\nA completed Quality Plan should demonstrate that all appropriate steps have been \ntaken to deliver items or services to purchaser requirements, including details of the \norganisations involved and references to control documents and appropriate records.  \n\nFor complex items that are fabricated, manufactured or erected in stages, there may \nbe several Quality Plans which support a top level quality plan. Quality Plan operations \nwhich are carried out by different organisations should make reference to the \narrangements for releasing items or services from one to the other and the quality \nplans that control the ongoing work.  \n\n8.10  A quality plan should identify or reference all those documents which form the \n\npurchaser\u2019s document package and include such aspects as qualification of personnel, \nfabrication procedures, material certification and traceability, consumable specification, \nconcessions and rework, manufacture, fabrication instructions, heat treatment records, \n\nReport CNS-TAST-GD-4.2 \nTRIM Ref: 2017/106056 \n\nPage 6 of 9 \n\n \nOFFICIAL  \n \n \n\n\fOffice for Nuclear Regulation  \n \n \n\nOFFICIAL  \n \n \n\ninspection and test results (including those from the purchaser, second, and third party \ninspection organisations). \n\n8.11  Quality Plans should identify steps for release, transport, handover and the process \n\nthat will control the interfaces between organisations. The release process to the \npurchaser from the supplier should identify and record any approved deviations from \ncontract requirements, specified intent and any outstanding actions. \n\nRecords \n\n8.12  The importance of identification and retention of design, procurement, manufacturing, \n\nfabrication and inspection records cannot be overstated as these ultimately support the \nsecurity plan. These should provide the evidence of assurance activities including \nthose carried out by the supplier and sub-suppliers and in some cases the purchaser. \nRecords also provide ONR with evidence of the application of assurance \narrangements and can be used to demonstrate compliance. \n\n8.13  Records form part of the demonstration that structures, systems and components meet \n\nthe design intent and nuclear security requirements. The identification, generation, \ntimely completion, handover and retention of records associated with the supply of \nitems or services, should form part of the contractual arrangements between purchaser \nand supplier at all levels of the Supply Chain.  \n\n8.14  The purchaser should identify all the records required to be delivered to the purchaser \nduring or on completion of the contract. Particular attention should be given to material \ntraceability and inspection, test and surveillance activities. \n\n8.15  Tracking of record packages by unique reference and plant item unique numbers will \n\naid interim and full system sign off prior to pre and post commissioning testing. The \npurchaser should develop the lifetime record package tracking process and ensure the \nsupplier\u2019s contract arrangements identify this process and their role within that \nprocess. \n\nInspectors should consider:  \n\n\uf0b7 \n\n \n\uf0b7 \n\n \n\uf0b7 \n\n \n\uf0b7 \n\n \n\uf0b7 \n\nAre the supplier\u2019s management system arrangements appropriate to the \nrisks of the items of services being supplied?  \n\nAre Quality Plans comprehensive and inclusive of the full sequence of steps \nrequired to deliver the item or service, including references to assurance \nactivities and applicable codes and standards? \n\nDo Quality Plans identify inspection/witness/review and hold points for all the \nrequired inspection parties? \n\nAre Quality Plans being adhered to and are they fully signed off after each \nstep has been completed? \n\nHas the Purchaser put adequate contractual arrangements in place to \nensure that relevant records are identified and provided by the Supply Chain \nin the correct form and to the required timescale?  \n\n \n\n \n\n \nOFFICIAL  \n \n \n\nReport CNS-TAST-GD-4.2 \nTRIM Ref: 2017/106056 \n\nPage 7 of 9 \n\n\fOffice for Nuclear Regulation  \n \n \n\nOFFICIAL  \n \n \n\n9. \n\n1.  \n \n2. \n \n3. \n\n \n4. \n\n \n5.  \n\n \n \n6. \n\nREFERENCES \n\nSecurity Assessment Principles \u2013 Trim Ref. 2017/121036   \n\nNuclear Industries Security Regulations 2003.
