Look at big or current or important projects first

Keep track of a request project with a UUID
Have a few rules about how projects get in and out of the portfolio
Don't use lists, use labels to keep track of projects
Don't mix up project list with project reports
Don't ask for more information than you can act upon
Do a little bit less
Improve a few projects at a time
