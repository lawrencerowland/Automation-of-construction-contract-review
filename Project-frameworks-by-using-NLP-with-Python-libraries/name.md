# Setting-up projects with known success-factors

# Key points
1. Projects can be characterised to reflect their specific business domain.
2. This is reflected in project plans, documentation, features and strategy.
3. These artefacts are generated from a success-factors paper & business library.
4. This is generated by a knowledge graph that uses keyword & topic models.
5. Software is free and method is recorded, so it can be applied by project teams.

# Abstract
Projects are often controlled with plans, documentation lists, feature lists and strategies. We demonstrate how to create these artefacts from document libraries and a list of project success-characteristics. These sources are specific to the sector and organisation in question. In this way, we generate slim project-management artefacts that are both consistent and applicable to the project context. This is done by using natural language processing to generate a knowledge graph which generates the four artefacts. This worked-example looks at the project characteristics for a UK nuclear decommissioning project.

More central documents have more connections to other documents.
e.g. Waste itemisation database, Facilities Description and regulation.
# OUTPUT 3: Feature list for project work-packages
These are the domain-specific features that should be tracked across the project. i.e. they are the attributes or properties captured for each work-package or sub-project. In this case, many of the features relate to requirements and site/stakeholder  aspects that relate to project tasks. 

| Work-package feature           | Work-package 1 | Work-package 2 |
| ------------------------------ | -------------- | -------------- |
| Facilities affected            |                |                |

| Relevant regulations           |                |                |

| Security performance           |                |                |

These features should be considered for inclusion in any lists and reports per Work-package. This work-package list may be an Excel sheet, or in Power BI or in an EPM system, or SQL database.These features are a key element of the project data-model.

# OUTPUT 4: Project Strategy Table of Contents
The project strategy assists:
- stakeholder groups to understand the business justification
- the team to understand the method of execution. 

<img src="Jupyter-notebooks/images/Strategy_TOC.png" width="300">

The structure should reflect the characteristics of project success in the business domain as well as the language and interests of the strategy consumers.

This worked-example settled on one of several possible structures, allowing Requirements the highest level in the hierarchy. Two merits of our approach:
- selection of a particular structure is explicit
- stakeholders can be involved in selection.

# INPUT 2: A library of relevant guidance / regulations
The UK Office of Nuclear Regulation  publishes a set of [technical guidance](http://www.onr.org.uk/operational/tech_asst_guides/index.htm) This is a set of pdf documents. This is one element of the regulatory context for nuclear decommissioning projects. A subset of 17 documents were selected for their relevance to project and technical management.

# Methods
## Automated Keyword extraction
Keywords are extracted from the regulations library by scoring each word by how linked that word is to other well-linked words. This provides not just a list of keywords, but also the strength of relationships between keywords. This is done by using the TextRank algorithm, which is like the Google PageRank algorithm for web-pages.
## Automated Topic Modelling
The strongest topics across the regulation library are identified by a topic model method called Latent Direchlet Allocation, or LDA. Murdock (2019)[^[@misc{murdock2019topic,
    title={Topic Modeling the Reading and Writing Behavior of Information Foragers},
    author={Jaimie Murdock},
    year={2019},
    eprint={1907.00488},
    archivePrefix={arXiv},
    link [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.00488v1)] says that 

> 'LDA is a generative model that represents each document as a bag of words generated by a mixture of topics.'

> 'It posits that each document has a distribution of contexts, or topics, that it is composed of.'

## Knowledge graph creation
The above methods generate lists of key concepts from the regulation library, as well as lists of relationships between concepts. The concepts become 'nodes' of a knowledge graph, and the relationships become 'edges' between these nodes. 

> e.g. 'radioactivity' is related to 'waste'. This is an edge connecting 2 nodes.

The success-factors paper contributes a number of success factors, as well as a number of recommended project services to be carried out by the project management team. These are added as nodes. Edges are added where there are:
-  relationships between success factors
-  between project services
-  between a success factor and a project task.

Groups of similar nodes have the same 'labels'.e.g.'success_factor','project_service'.

This combined knowledge graph is one interpretation of project success in Nuclear DeCommissioning.
Next, the project team:
1.  views the graph for useful patterns
2.  reinforces patterns by changing nodes and edges and labels.

The outputs are generated by querying the knowledge graph for specific labels. For example, the Strategy TOC relates to a query which asks for nodes with labels in this order: 

> (requirements)-->(success_factor)-->(project_service)-->(site or stakeholder) 

## Method and guide for use
The method, along with a guide sufficient for using this on other libraries and projects, is [here](https://github.com/lawrencerowland/Data-Model-for-Project-Frameworks/tree/master/Project-frameworks-by-using-NLP-with-Python-libraries) *July 2020 note: its all there, but working on making it easier to read*
# Technology applied
All technology is free to use, without subscription. The code is written up in Jupyter notebooks, which allows guidance to sit alongside the code, so limited coding experience is needed. 
1. Gensim is OpenSource
2. NetworkX is OpenSource
3. Neo4j Desktop is free. 
4. Jupyter Notebooks and Python are OpenSource.
5. Yfiles Neo4j Explorer is free

# Business challenge
1. Projects have success-factor
# Motivation
# Use Cases
 
# Directions
1. Ongoing project management within graph database
2. Graph neural networks hosted on graph database
# Limitations
The purpose has been to give a working example that is easy to follow. 
1. I have chosen a business sector where I have limited experience. That has allowed me to work through the logic of the example, rather than to use my sector experience.
2. The results should not be used without scrutiny and amendment by nuclear project managers.
3. A limited number of keywords were selected
4. A limited number of documents were used (16)
5. regulations were not read. 
6. there are other regulations which apply, beyond ONR. 

For use on a real project, I recommend:
1. working with project experts during the knowledge-graph stage
2. 'human-in-the-loop' filtering of keywords and topics
3. adding the organisation's selected project framework as one of the input knowledge graphs
4. adding the high-level views of key stakeholders as one of the inputs into the knowledge graph

# Further information
Clustering also indicates four types of documentation:
1. high level definitions
2. site specific 
3. design and system descriptions
4. stakeholder and controls documents.

# Viewing knowledge graph 
1. Go to [sandbox](https://sandbox.neo4j.com/)
2. log in: lgrowla@gmail.com 
3. 
# Other ways of saying
Context >> Patterns >> Form
Establish context, seek patterns, and use them to define the form of the project.
Bundle together the entire business context of the project, then unbundle enough of this to define the project, and deploy the project.
