# Setting-up projects with known success-factors

# Key points
1. Projects can be characterised to reflect their specific business domain.
2. This is reflected in project plans, documentation, features and strategy.
3. These artefacts are generated from a success-factors paper & business library.
4. This is generated by a knowledge graph that uses keyword & topic models.
5. Software and method is free, and can be applied by project teams.

***What** These are the domain-specific features that should be tracked across the project. i.e. they are the attributes or properties captured for each work-package or sub-project. These features are also known as the project data model. 

***Where*** They will be captured in project records. These records may be in:
- a spreadsheet
- a project folder
- a project database
- an Enterprise Project Management tool
- a cloud EPM tool
Some of these feature will appear in project reports and dashboards.

***Why*** These features are key element of the data model for the project, to represent the special characteristics of projects in this business domain. 

If unnecessary features are captured, they will not be used to guide the project, and will be a waste of money and a distraction. 

***With what else?*** These features are often added to features from standard project data models .i.e. scope, schedule, cost etc.

# Topic model

# Paper
Success criteria were taken from the paper. 
- extraction focussed on success factors for DeCom that were contributed by the paper

| Success factor            | Description                                         |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| "Know site conditions"    | "detailed knowledge of the site conditions"         |
| "Authority relationships" | "good relationship with the regulatory authorities" |
| "Storage availability"    | "the availability of storage facilities"            |
| "Clear end state"         | "Clear site end state permits scope definition"     |
| "Stable funding"          | "Stable funding"                                    |
| "plan early"              | "It’s a plan that goes from cradle to grave!"       |
| "Qualified resources"     | "The availability of suitably qualified resources"  |

Where the paper proposed project tasks in line with the success factor these were recorded.

# Project features: the Data model

What attributes should be recorded and tracked for each work-package?

- This will normally come from the project framework that has been chosen and the Enterprise Project Management system which is being used. 

- This exercise has highlighted a number of features relevant to successful DeCom projects within an ONR environment.

1. These are taken from the graph database by running a query asking for every requirement or site-element that is directly related to any of the Project services.

2. This produces Column 1, from which we define the relevant work-package characteristic we should know throughout the project (see Column 2)

3. We recommend that these features be considered for inclusion in any lists and reports per Work-package. This work-package list may be an Excel sheet, or in Power BI or in an EPM system, or SQL database

# Other ways of saying
Context >> Patterns >> Form
Establish context, seek patterns, and use them to define the form of the project.
Bundle together the entire business context of the project, then unbundle enough of this to define the project, and deploy the project. 
# Directions
1. Ongoing project management within graph database
2. Graph neural networks hosted on graph database

# Further information
Clustering also indicates four types of documentation:
1. high level definitions
2. site specific 
3. design and system descriptions
4. stakeholder and controls documents.
