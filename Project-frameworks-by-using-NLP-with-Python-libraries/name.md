# Setting-up projects with known success-factors

# Key points
1. Projects can be characterised to reflect their specific business domain.
2. This is reflected in project plans, documentation, features and strategy.
3. These artefacts are generated from a success-factors paper & business library.
4. This is generated by a knowledge graph that uses keyword & topic models.
5. Software is free and method is recorded, so it can be applied by project teams.

# Abstract
Projects are often controlled with plans, documentation lists, feature lists and strategies. We demonstrate how to create these artefacts from document libraries and a list of project success-characteristics. These sources are specific to the sector and organisation in question. In this way, we generate slim project-management artefacts that are both consistent and applicable to the project context. This is done by using natural language processing to generate a knowledge graph which generates the four artefacts. This worked-example looks at the project characteristics for a UK nuclear decommissioning project.

More central documents have more connections to other documents.

# OUTPUT 3: Feature list for project work-packages
These are the domain-specific features that should be tracked across the project. i.e. they are the attributes or properties captured for each work-package or sub-project. In this case, many of the features relate to requirements and site/stakeholder  aspects that relate to project tasks. 

| Work-package feature           | Work-package 1 | Work-package 2 |
| ------------------------------ | -------------- | -------------- |
| Facilities affected            |                |                |

| Relevant regulations           |                |                |

| Security performance           |                |                |

These features should be considered for inclusion in any lists and reports per Work-package. This work-package list may be an Excel sheet, or in Power BI or in an EPM system, or SQL database.These features are a key element of the project data-model.

# OUTPUT 4: Project Strategy Table of Contents
The project strategy assists:
- stakeholder groups to understand the business justification
- the team to understand the method of execution. 

<img src="Jupyter-notebooks/images/Strategy_TOC.png" width="350">

The structure should reflect the characteristics of project success in the business domain as well as the language and interests of the strategy consumers.

This worked-example settled on one of several possible structures, allowing Requirements the highest level in the hierarchy. Two merits of the approach:
- selection of a particular structure is explicit
- stakeholders can be involved in selection.

To link to this article: https://doi.org/10.1080/01446193.2020.1775859)] propose the following factors in successful nuclear decommissioning projects:

| Success factor            | Description                                         |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| "Know site conditions"    | "detailed knowledge of the site conditions"         |
| "Authority relationships" | "good relationship with the regulatory authorities" |

# INPUT 2: A library of relevant guidance / regulations
The UK Office of Nuclear Regulation  publishes a set of [technical guidance](http://www.onr.org.uk/operational/tech_asst_guides/index.htm) This is a set of pdf documents. This is one element of the regulatory context for nuclear decommissioning projects. A subset of 17 documents were selected for their relevance to project and technical management.

# Business challenge
- Project structure is often copied from project to project
	- sometimes not fit for purpose
	- sometimes more heavy-weight than needed
- Project plans, strategies and controls are often created separately
# Business motivation
- ensure project characteristics make their way into project controls
- track only the project features that are important
- standardise early consultation across multiple stakeholders and standards
- consistently apply research-findings to improve project performance
# Use Cases
 1. Set-up project in new business area
 2. Set-up project where there are diverse stakeholders and business languages
 3. Refresh organisation's project-model if track-record is poor
 4. up-skill project teams in flexible data-models and machine-learning.

# Methods
## Automated Keyword extraction
Keywords are extracted from the regulations library by scoring each word by how linked that word is to other well-linked words. This provides not just a list of keywords, but also the strength of relationships between keywords. This is done by using the TextRank algorithm, which is like the Google PageRank algorithm for web-pages.
## Automated Topic Modelling
The strongest topics across the regulation library are identified by a topic model method called Latent Direchlet Allocation, or LDA. Murdock (2019)[^[@misc{murdock2019topic,
    title={Topic Modeling the Reading and Writing Behavior of Information Foragers},
    author={Jaimie Murdock},
    year={2019},
    eprint={1907.00488},
    archivePrefix={arXiv},
    link [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.00488v1)] says that 

> 'LDA is a generative model that represents each document as a bag of words generated by a mixture of topics.'

> 'It posits that each document has a distribution of contexts, or topics, that it is composed of.'

## Knowledge graph creation
The above methods generate lists of key concepts from the regulation library, as well as lists of relationships between concepts. The concepts become 'nodes' of a knowledge graph, and the relationships become 'edges' between these nodes. 

> e.g. 'radioactivity' is related to 'waste'. This is an edge connecting 2 nodes.

The success-factors paper contributes a number of success factors, as well as a number of recommended project services to be carried out by the project management team. These are added as nodes. Edges are added where there are:
-  relationships between success factors
-  between project services
-  between a success factor and a project task.

Groups of similar nodes have the same 'labels'.e.g.'success_factor','project_service'.

This combined knowledge graph is one interpretation of project success in Nuclear DeCommissioning.
Next, the project team:
1.  views the graph for useful patterns
2.  reinforces patterns by changing nodes and edges and labels.

The outputs are generated by querying the knowledge graph for specific labels. For example, the Strategy TOC relates to a query which asks for nodes with labels in this order: 

> (requirements)-->(success_factor)-->(project_service)-->(site or stakeholder) 

# Technology applied
All technology is free to use, without subscription. The code is written up in Jupyter notebooks, which allows guidance to sit alongside the code, so limited coding experience is needed. 
1. Gensim is OpenSource
2. NetworkX is OpenSource
3. Neo4j Desktop is free. 
4. Jupyter Notebooks and Python are OpenSource.
5. Yfiles Neo4j Explorer is free

# Application to a project
1. clone repository. Apply Jupyter notebooks to your documents
2. use 'human-in-the-loop' filtering of keywords and topics
3. work with project experts during the knowledge-graph stage.

*optional* 

4. use many more documents and keywords where required
5. add stakeholder criteria just as the success paper was added
6. add the team's preferred project framework in the same way.

# Our contribution

> context >> patterns >> form

We apply business *context* to a project. This provides an agreed *form* or structure. We do this by seeking *patterns* and reinforcing those which stakeholders recognise.

Another way of saying the same thing:

> bundle >> unbundle >> deploy

1. *bundle up* the entire business context of the project
2. *unbundle* just enough to structure the project
3. *deploy* the project against this project structure. 
# Limitations
This has been a simple working-example.The results should not be used without scrutiny and amendment by nuclear project managers.
- I have limited experience of the nuclear sector  
- a limited number of keywords were used
- a limited number of documents were used
- I did not review the regulations. 
- there are other regulations which apply. 
# Future directions
1. *better strategic alignment* via simultaneous multiple strategic views at any one time. Each view reflects a different stakeholder perspective of what matters. 
2. *manage business dependencies* by managing project within graph database
3. *project success prediction* via graph neural networks hosted on graph database

[NetworkX] used to create knowledge graph from keywords

[Neo4j](www.neo4j.com) Desktop is a graph database used here to create the knowledge graph. 

[Jupyter Notebooks](www.jupyter.org) is an accessible way to provide both guidance and images alongside code in a notebook format.
