# Purpose

Have a body of Portfolio services that everyone can understand and use

**REASON FOR HAVING A SIMPLE DEPLOYABLE PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK**

***Typical internal pain points***

Content is hard to find, patchy, and out of date
Portfolio schemes are set up either from scratch or copy and paste. 
Portfolio framework does not improve from year to year
There is no standard way of delivering a portfolio service

***What success looks like internally***

1. Portfolio framework is complete and straightforward to access 
2. Portfolio management tasks can be planned and estimated in a consistent way
3. Each portfolio tasks starts from an inherited service descriptions, task plan, and tool or template.

***Artefacts***

Portfolio Service modules	within a Catalogue
Each portfolio instance will be a variant /fork of the relevant modules. 

**AND SIMILARLY FOR THOSE COMPETING TO PROVIDE PORTFOLIO SERVICES

***OBJECTIVE:

Have a body of Portfolio services that is consistent between Sales and Delivery

***External pain points 

Inconsistent Bidding on a suite of services
Resourcing and pricing is not standardised
Engagements are only more or less related to service as specified during sales.

# Example
A Portfolio services delivery framework looks like this:

![](/images/Portfolio-services-mapped-to-business-needs-Rowland-and-Lewis.png)

It can be opened and edited [here](/Portfolio-services-mapped-to-business-needs-Rowland-and-Lewis.graphml) can be viewed and modified in a graph package. I suggest YEd live.

***What success looks like:

***Optional extra Artefacts
