# Determine prioritisation context: Session 1

HISTORY e.g. Layer upon layer of incremental decisions
CRITERIA e.g. Feasibility (Practicability), desirability, Departmental alignment, departmental targets, 
MAGNITUDE e.g. Order of magnitude issue
MATURITY GROWTH e.g.What did not happen last year
GRANULARITY (Work-package, Project, Programme) 
FLIGHT-PHASE e.g. With projects mid-flight, this is not an initial exercise
SUSTAINABILITY Is this an ongoing prioritisation need,  
FINANCIAL CONTEXT e.g. Coming at time of efficiencies, this is becoming a financial optimisation exercise of whole site cost
FORCING FUNCTIONS e.g. Rehabilitation of safety score, and at what level (-site-programme-project )
CONTENTS e.g. a project set with one big project, and high risk levels: not a typical portfolio expressed as risk and return. 

# Constraints and outcomes: Session 2
Hard landscape of external commitments, and physical / safety , necessities, contract dates
Start the benefits mapping / outcome / drivers mapping in a square
End-states pull. Existing projects push

# Dependencies: Session 3:
Put the first two or three on the grid as example
Identifying what comes together
-Start from the operating ‘stack’
-Key dependency (adjacencies: i.e. turn dependencies into managed interfaces, esp. by drawing the stack right, as adjacencies fall out)
-Link into asset strategy. Cost efforts: Engineering commonality, commercial commonality, CM challenge commonality
Walk through the main blocks of common sense what needs to be done project wise, build up with the experts, what is non-negotiable.

# Strategy / optimisation module: session 4
Identify several possible courses of action
Chemical engineering flow approach (for some sectors)
Optimisation by site-area (for spatially oriented sectors
Parallel and serial mapping  (conflict running )


# Basic intent module / state : session 5
Shrive off Incubation / Core business curve (return against novelty
Exec’s ‘intent’ map
Work back from interim and end-states
Possible interim configurations
Also do a function collection for subsequent site  configurations

# detailed Prioritisation: session 6
If Pairwise
-It's not a league table of weightings, it's a Boolean table of cost, hazard, feasibility, plus one. 
-A series of sequential pair-wise decisions. Stepwise and adjust,etc
-Micro trade-offs between hazard and cost, done with A pair of projects
The trade-off is different as you go down the list. 

I.e. identify what things enable other things at low marginal cost
Lots of short sprint 3-4 month jobs

understanding strike rates of projects near finish (at what stage can they be switched off) . 
Conjoining uncertainty envelopes across projects


# Cost model: session 7
Consider the summation
The most likely multiyear envelope not the next year envelope
Identify what is BAU and business critical
these become your true fixed costs and the starter for your interim states
Identify what is margin. Identify marginal costs and benefits
Marginal benefits then will influence a pairwise comparison, 
Common efficiencies (I.e. can also be expressed parametrically). Utilisation curves
what work is lost if stopped 
Calc cost if delayed : that certain cost is the bow wave you are breaking
Deliberate representation of sunk cost so it can be struck off
Cost curve analysis (where is the optimal area). Unit cost against volume
Utilisation curves
mapping to commercial / trade
smooth contractor and mobilisation curves

# Approach to sessions
-Positioning, negotiation and repetition
-Has to be done as a series of finite options with the nda with time periods. Doing them all at once may be a unnecessary complexification 
-Risk optimisation (incl. identify what needs to be done never to enter the critical stage of pressurised work)
