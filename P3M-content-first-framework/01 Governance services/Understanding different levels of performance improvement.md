# Different levels
There appear different levels of process that are involved here. Perhaps it is something like:
L1: Physical  architecture and processes during operation

L1 is underpinned by L2
- L2: A Design Process that feeds a Manufacture Process.

L3 gets improved by L3:
- L3: An ideas process leading into initiatives process for cost-savings

Cost-savings may originate from changes at any  level. If you are trying to improve the generation and execution of such cost-savings, then you can do this in several ways:

1. Immediate improvements by running L3 better through practical management measures: 
casual meeting to get obvious omissions back on track
Improved tracking and management of the existing process

2. Planned process improvements to L3. You already have some sort of process for CHIPS and for RODS. But you can make planned improvements, such as you suggest:
Understand explicit and implied tasks at L3. 
Review data and survey staff to update an estimate of time allowances for each task and sub-task:
Or possibly convert some of the L3 process by adopting LEAN methodologies 
Improve the definition and monitoring of the performance metrics at different stages of the process
Analyse and improve the governance of the process (i.e. the decisions made) by improving the stages and the gates applied
Check that participants understand and agree L3, and improve communications.

3. Improvements by making use of Category and Process definitions at L1 and L2: Much of what happens and L1 and L2 must be clearly described and understood. People know their jobs. I.e. The Product can be broken down into categories of system (in a system architecture for example), and the related design and manufacture tasks are clearly defined. 

Each cost-saving idea will relate to: 
Into one or more category / sub-system / asset type
 and to a process or processes (at both L1 and L2 levels). 
Occasionally a cost-saving will relate to a new category or a new process, which can then be incorporated into the L1 L2 definitions. 

Much of the material you already capture would help you relate cost-saving ideas to L1 and L2 categories and processes. 

My point is that you can make more use of these defined processes and categories to understand your issues already identified. You can base your understanding top-down from these L1 and L2 definitions, and from the bottom-up you can analyse past and present issues to understand how they fit into these defined categories and processes.

4. Improvements by Category and Process definition at L3: You could also do the same thing at L3. i.e. understand more about the categories of cost-saving that crop up. E.g. Some might be supplier management, some are component-rationalisation. You could talk with engineers and analyse your data to discover the types of cost-saving that there are, and which are more likely to be successful. What feasibility tests need to be passed by each cost saving? By developing a shared understanding of the way that L3 is done well, you can start to support co-operation across the community. 


I suggest that it is helpful if even poor ideas coming out, because:
it shows that engineers are motivated to improve the process
suggestions provide valuable information about appears to be working at the shop-floor. 

If many of these ideas cannot be used, that is a signal to which the management can respond by: 
Providing a provide a better understanding of the challenge as you see it, or 
Providing better feedback to engineers why an idea is not pursued, or
Give engineers more access / awareness to what has / has not worked in the past, or elsewhere in the business


# Conclusion
There are at least four different ways of making things better within your role. You wonâ€™t want to do all of them. But there may be one or two areas which you could select and try to work through. You may also wish to see one or more of the Pcubed service offering sources that I have referred to above (A to D). There is no point doing that until you have considered which type of improvement might be worth trying first.
