## From interview, one might take the following key points
J has some objectives for the next financial year
- set up an office to manage the P3 portfolio
- transform IT so that it outperforms Competitor 2

J s seeking particular outcomes for the business 
- reduce costs across the business
- close innovation projects in stage xxx that fail certain criteria

J is working closely with
- The Board
- PMO
- IT division

To achieve her objectives, Joel wants to understand
How she should be supporting the mission of his Strategy director
- what a portfolio office is and whether that is what he needs
- what organisation she needs
- what support she needs
- what the plan should be 


J expects to run particular portfolio services for the business 
- select an appropriate portfolio
- align the portfolio to the strategy
- manage a portfolio
- assure the portfolio 
- continuous improvement 

J has several touchpoints into the wider business: 
- the strategic pillars
- the IT lifecycle
- the PMO lifecycle

J would recognise an operational rhythm something like  
- Test
- Measure
- Learn.

## Accordingly, the first place to start is to present this back

## Second place, is to organise the strategy report against the above implied structure
