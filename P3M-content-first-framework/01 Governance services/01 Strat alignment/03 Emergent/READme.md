# Strategic agility

- Articulating existing strategy

- So that portfolios can readily be prepared

- Being able to pivot strategy, and reset portfolio fast, again and again

# Where to start

The guide and tools for this are in the Portfolio data model [repository](https://github.com/lawrencerowland/Data-models-for-portfolios)

# when to use

- If you are seeking to recast the operating model of your business 

- If it might help to visualise and articulate that operating model 
in different ways 
for different business partners 

- If you  require your operating model to change and adjust as your understanding and objectives go on ?

# Alternate uses

- communicate your operating model to your business 
in a series of operating-steps

- reset your transformation agenda for delivering that model 
(i.e. your portfolio of projects)

- retain the existing portfolio and integrate with it
and / or the operating landscape

# justification

“The 2017 edition of the World Economic Forum in Davos is framed under the overall umbrella of ‘Responsive and Responsible Leadership’.

- “Institutionalize a focused, value-based, dynamic ‘agenda management’ governance system (separating the Decision from the Delivery agenda) that is not bound to traditional planning cycles, but has as its core objective more, better, higher-value decisions faster, with faster, high-quality execution. While this not new and has been applied with great success by large organizations in the past, we now have much better enablers (such as data analytics).
- Use the new technologies at our disposal to create a dynamic and fully integrated planning, while connecting the dots from strategy development all the way down to operational planning. For example:
- Accept the reality that “static” three-year plans and budgets no longer work. In today’s world, you have to constantly re-forecast based on real-time and predictive data analytics.
- Consequently, adopt a “dynamic, value-based resource allocation” approach to capital management, whereby a clear distinction is made between capital allocation, capital release, and capital sanctioning.”
