People management will be key. Upgrading resource capabilities require support from a new capability of competence management. Staff capabilities require identification, development, and allocation to the right type of project. Furthermore, the skills of project managers and Sub-Portfolio managers need to be improved so that they can meet their responsibilities as per job descriptions, notably stage gates, planning, risk and dependency management. Exhibiting the right values and behaviours will enable improved performance on projects and by individuals. Ultimately this can be further enhanced achieving better people engagement through enhancing leadership skills at all levels and linking individual performance objectives to organisation objectives.
By introducing a behavioural change component, the organisation could build from these individual competencies into a wider mind-set change and cultural change. This would relate to how people engage with each other and with their job. On the basis of this behavioural change, trust can be built between teams and departments. Extending this to the supply chain and internal clients would strengthen relationship and stakeholder management. Internal communications can be reviewed in conjunction with the other heads of department.
