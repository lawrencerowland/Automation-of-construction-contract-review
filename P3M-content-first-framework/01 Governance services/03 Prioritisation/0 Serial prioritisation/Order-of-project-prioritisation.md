# Benefits of serial prioritisation

- Gives an account of why these projects will be needed
- avoid having a haircut across all projects

# When to go heavy

When you understand criteria better than the projects
Focused on ensuring that the portfolio is balanced across all criteria (weighted)
Linear optimization
One big calculation, when all the issues can be summarized and cracked all at once
Longer lead time than results all at once
Separate site cost model available
Neater to justify algorithm results
Allows several scenarios to be created, showing the impact of different criteria weightings
Investment portfolios with risk and return both in £

# When to stay light
When to stay light

When you understand projects better than criteria
Focused on comparison of investment business cases
A series of trade off decisions
Many smaller 1-1 comparisons, plus emergent criteria as we learn our preferences
Big priority results early, then process is slower
Anticipates cost optimisation and site optimisation
Easier to justify inclusion of each project in words
Allows criteria to have different weightings at different stages in the process
Scenario planning 

# Committed stage criteria:

Regulatory commitments
Possibly sub-contractor commitments
