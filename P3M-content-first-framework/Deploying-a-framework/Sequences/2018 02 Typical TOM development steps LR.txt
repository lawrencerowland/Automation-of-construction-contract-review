Here are some suggested stages to consider for the design and development of a changed TOM which 
focusses on better delivery of IT programmes and projects. I have focussed more on the early stages, as 
if these are done right, then steps 9-11 are easier to break down into the right detailed steps a little 
later. Some of the activities can be concurrent, notably 3 and 4, and also 6,7,8 and also 9,10. You might 
not want all of these, but it’s a reasonable shopping list to start with.

1.	The Objectives and context of the TOM
a.	Strategy Alignment within the wider business
b.	Wider sector, consumer, competitor context, market features and externalities
c.	Conduct organisation sense-making (the art of the possible)
d.	Innovation and technological key elements.
2.	Plan and set up programme for the design and development phases of the TOM
3.	As-is assessment
a.	Capability
b.	Maturity 
c.	Performance
4.	Develop TOM requirements
a.	Performance requirements
b.	Functional requirements
c.	Constraints
d.	Best practice and sector-benchmarking
5.	High Level options
a.	Generate options
b.	Evaluate options (strategy, feasibility, financials)
c.	Agree option
d.	Agree key staging for preferred option
6.	Full feasibility assessment
7.	High-level business case
8.	Stakeholder buy-in
a.	Re-align with the business
b.	Change management and communications at different levels
c.	success criteria and rollback arrangements
9.	Detailed Design 
10.	Implementation planning 
11.	Implementation in stages including acceptance and adoption.
