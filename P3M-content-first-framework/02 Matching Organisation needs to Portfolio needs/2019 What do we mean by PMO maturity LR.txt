1.	I find it helpful to work through with a client whether they need to judge maturity, or capability, 
or performance of a PMO, or a blend. i.e. capability assessments are more useful when you may 
not have all the organisational capability you need. Maturity is relevant once you have a 
capability. Finally, you can have a mature PMO capability, but you may find that actual portfolio 
or programme or project performance is no better for it, and you need to take a different 
approach
2.	We might want to understand whether the client clear about what the scope of the current 
PMO is (i.e. is it for one project or many projects or one programme or all programmes, and for 
which department or all departments etc)
