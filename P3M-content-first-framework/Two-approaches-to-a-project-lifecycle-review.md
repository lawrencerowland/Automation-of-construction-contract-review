**Proposed approach to Delivery Lifecycle Capability**

Organisation wish us to assess whether the current process for client-projects is fit for purpose. The current lifecycle, as currently applied appears not to be working very well. We need to understand in what ways it is not working well. We also need to retain those elements of the lifecycle that are working well. We also need to identify where training or coaching is an issue, rather than the lifecycle itself.

We can see two possible ways of approaching this. The first could be used if it is considered likely that a completely new process will be needed. The second could be used if it is not known whether the lifecycle is at fault, or whether it may be more of training / competence issue where staff do not have guidelines or examples which show them how to apply the existing delivery lifecycle and product lifecycle.

APPROACH A would create a new process as follows:

Review the existing transformation work done by the PMO

Review the current lifecycle (both product and delivery) considering whether it is fit for purpose where Organisation is only the supplier. Write a report indicating where the current situation is not fit for purpose. Submit this to the licence holders of the current product and delivery lifecycles

Assuming that the current arrangements are not fit for purpose, identify the requirements of new integrated lifecycle (product and delivery). Time will need to be allowed in considering the organisational, behavioural and commercial requirements, since this is likely to involve a change in how Organisation deals with external parties.

Once this report has been reviewed and agreed within Organisation, then we recommend that this is submitted to the licence holders for review and comment. However Organisation may wish to send this as ‘information’, and inform the licence holders that Organisation are continuing with solution development

Prepare a new integrated lifecycle (product and delivery) that meets the specified requirements. Organisation should define what level of involvement in option creation and selection it wishes during this process. This lifecycle will include:

The handshake points across the lifecycle and the products

process maps

implications for knowledge management platforms

Support Organisation in its submission to the licence holders for a derogation in the current lifecycles, and in achieving corporate sign off of the new lifecycle

APPROACH B would review how the current process is being applied as follows:

1.  Review the existing transformation work done by the PMO
    
    We work with two full time project managers, who are working on setting up two client-led projects. We spend time providing content, reviewing the guidance, and prepare appropriate project documentation.
    
    We would review the outputs of these projects with the Organisation. We would agree together whether the outputs are satisfactory or not.
    
    **If the outputs are generally satisfactory**, then:
    
    tidy up the documents so they could be circulated and shared as case studies / examples of best practice in applying the current lifecycles (product and delivery) to client led projects
    
    write a guidance note showing how we used / interpreted the delivery lifecycle and product lifecycle documentation for  the use of PMs
    
    prepare process maps showing how the existing lifecycles come together in practice
    
    indicate current handshake points across the lifecycle and the products, and propose additional handshake points if necessary
    
    write a brief defects report for the current Lifecyle, indicating minor areas where improvement would be welcomed. Organisation would be able to discuss/ circulate that with the Projects and Operations community so that the standards can be updated at the next planned iteration
    
    **if the outputs are generally unsatisfactory,** then :
    
    write down the specific defects within the process and the outputs
    
    engage in a consultation process with the PMO and the Organisation PM community to understand any new requirements of a modified process
    
    would draft a position paper recommending these new requirements, and providing a justification for change. This would be in a format that Organisation could use to go into immediate dialogue with the standard holders. The purpose of this dialogue would either be to a) obtain a derogation from the standards for Organisation, or (b) to seek agreement for an overhaul of the Lifecycle by the standard holders
    
    additional services could be agreed if necessary at this stage, in terms of working through a solution based on these requirements, to support the standard holders.This would include process maps. However this is assumed to be an additional service, since it would need to be agreed whether Organisation and a consultant were doing the development work, or the licence holders of the current lifecycles.
