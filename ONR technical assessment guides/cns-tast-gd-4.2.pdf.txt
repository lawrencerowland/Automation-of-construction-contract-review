3.2 

The Office for Nuclear Regulation (ONR) has established a set of Security Assessment 
Principles (SyAPs) (Reference 1). This document contains Fundamental Security 
Principles (FSyPs) that dutyholders must demonstrate have been fully taken into 
account in developing their security arrangements to meet relevant legal obligations. 
The security regime for meeting these principles is described in security plans 
prepared by the dutyholders, which are approved by ONR under the Nuclear Industries 
Security Regulations (NISR) 2003 (Reference 2). 

The term ‘security plan’ is used to cover all dutyholder submissions such as nuclear 
site security plans, temporary security plans and transport security statements. NISR 
Regulation 22 dutyholders may also use the SyAPs as the basis for Cyber Security 
and Information Assurance (CS&IA) documentation that helps them demonstrate 
ongoing legal compliance for the protection of Sensitive Nuclear Information (SNI). The 
SyAPs are supported by a suite of guides to assist ONR inspectors in their 
assessment and inspection work, and in making regulatory judgements and decisions.  
This Technical Assessment Guidance (TAG) is such a guide. 

2. 

PURPOSE AND SCOPE 

This TAG contains guidance to advise and inform ONR inspectors in exercising their 
regulatory judgment during assessment activities relating to a dutyholder’s supply 
chain management arrangements.  It aims to provide general advice and guidance to 
ONR inspectors on how this aspect of security should be assessed. It does not set out 
how ONR regulates the dutyholder’s arrangements.  It does not prescribe the detail, 
targets or methodologies for dutyholders to follow in demonstrating they have 
addressed the SyAPs. It is the dutyholder’s responsibility to determine and describe 
this detail and for ONR to assess whether the arrangements are adequate.   

3. 

RELATIONSHIP TO RELEVANT LEGISLATION 

The term ‘dutyholder’ mentioned throughout this guide is used to define ‘responsible 
persons’ on civil nuclear licensed sites and other nuclear premises subject to security 
regulation, a ‘developer’ carrying out work on a nuclear construction site and approved 
carriers, as defined in NISR. It is also used to refer to those holding SNI. 

NISR defines a ‘nuclear premises’ and requires ‘the responsible person’ as defined to 
have an approved security plan in accordance with Regulation 4. It further defines 
approved carriers and requires them to have an approved Transport Security 
Statement in accordance with Regulation 16. Persons to whom Regulation 22 applies 
are required to protect SNI. ONR considers supply chain management to be an 
important component of a dutyholder’s arrangements in demonstrating compliance 
with relevant legislation. 

4. 

RELATIONSHIP TO IAEA DOCUMENTATION AND GUIDANCE 

4.1 

The essential elements of a national nuclear security regime are set out in the 
Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material (CPPNM) (Reference 3) and 
the IAEA Nuclear Security Fundamentals (Reference 4). Further guidance is available 
within IAEA Technical Guidance and Implementing Guides.

4.2 

Fundamental Principle J of the CPPNM refers to quality assurance and states that ‘a 
quality assurance policy and quality assurance programmes should be established and 
implemented with a view to providing confidence that specified requirements for all 
activities important to physical protection are satisfied’. The importance of issues 
relating to assurance activities are also recognised in the Nuclear Security 
Fundamentals, specifically: 

 

Essential Element 12: Sustaining a Nuclear Security Regime – 3.12  

h) Routinely performing assurance activities to identify and address issues 
and factors that may affect the capacity to provide adequate nuclear 
security including cyber security at all times. 

A more detailed description of the elements is provided in Recommendations level 
guidance, specifically Nuclear Security Series (NSS) 13, Recommendations on 
Physical Protection of Nuclear Material and Nuclear Facilities (INFCIRC/225/Revision 
5) (Reference 5). 

5. 

RELATIONSHIP TO NATIONAL POLICY DOCUMENTS 

The SyAPs provide ONR inspectors with a framework for making consistent regulatory 
judgements on the effectiveness of a dutyholder’s security arrangements.  This TAG 
provides guidance to ONR inspectors when assessing a dutyholder’s submission 
demonstrating they have effective processes in place to achieve SyDP 4.2 – Supplier 
Capability, in support of FSyP 4 – Nuclear Supply Chain Management.  The TAG is 
consistent with other TAGs and associated guidance and policy documentation. 

The HMG Security Policy Framework (SPF) (Reference 6) describes the Cabinet 
Secretary’s expectations of how HMG organisations and third parties handling HMG 
information and other assets will apply protective security to ensure HMG can function 
effectively, efficiently and securely. The security outcomes and requirements detailed 
in the SPF have been incorporated within the SyAPs. This ensures that dutyholders 
are presented with a coherent set of expectations for the protection of nuclear 
premises, SNI and the employment of appropriate personnel security controls both on 
and off nuclear premises. 

5.3 

The Classification Policy (Reference 7) indicates those categories of SNI, which 
require protection and the level of security classification to be applied. 

6. 

ADVICE TO INSPECTORS 

6.1 

This TAG informs regulatory assessment of Supply Chain Management (SCM) 
arrangements with a particular focus on the supplier’s capability. It should be read 
together with the Safety TAG NS-TAST-GD 049 Rev 5 ‘Licensee Core and Intelligent 
Customer Capabilities’.  That TAG defines key terms: ‘core capability’, ‘contractor’ and 
‘intelligent customer’.   The TAG also relates the use of contractors to several Licence 
Conditions.   

Regulatory Expectations 

6.2 

The regulatory expectation is that dutyholders will describe in the security plan how 
they seek assurance of supplier capability to support effective nuclear supply chain 
management arrangements.

FSyP 4 - Nuclear Supply 
Chain Management 

Supplier Capability 

SyDP 4.2 

For work with nuclear security significance, dutyholders should evaluate and confirm that 
suppliers have the organisational and technical capability, capacity and culture to deliver 
items or services to the specification prior to placing any contract. 

 
The regulatory expectation from dutyholders is that they will evaluate and confirm 
suppliers have the organisational and technical capability, capacity and culture to 
deliver items or services to the specification prior to placing any contract for items or 
services identified as being of nuclear security significance. This expectation is in 
addition to the normal personnel security screening necessary for any contractor to 
gain access to a site or operation.  That process aims to counter the ‘insider threat’ 
and CPNI has produced a number of good practice guides on how this might be 
mitigated, with specific reference to contractors.    

The regulatory expectation from dutyholders is that they will ensure suppliers have 
quality management arrangements which are appropriate and consistent with the 
security significance of the procured items or services. In most cases dutyholders will 
use established contractors with a good track record.  Such contractors are likely to 
have the appropriate accreditations and associations.  For example: Security Industry 
Association’s Approved Contractor Scheme, BS EN ISO 9001 Quality Management 
Systems, membership of the Security Institute and related codes of practice and British 
Standards.   

For work with nuclear security significance, the purchaser should evaluate and confirm 
that suppliers have the organisational and technical capability, capacity and culture to 
deliver items or services to specification, prior to placing any contract.  

Suppliers should be selected by the purchaser after evaluation against pre-defined 
criteria appropriate to the contract. The criteria will test the supplier’s ability to meet the 
specified intent and should include information from the supplier that provides objective 
evidence of their capability and capacity to deliver the required item or service. The 
criteria for selection should be appropriately weighted to evaluate the supplier’s ability 
to meet the required security performance (e.g. protection of SNI) of the contract. 

Purchasers are expected to ensure that the supply chain has the organisational and 
technical capability to deliver items or services in line with their requirements. 
Suppliers’ organisational arrangements should include documented management 
system arrangements appropriate to the items or services being supplied. These 
systems should be implemented and be able to meet the requirements of any relevant 
national or international management system standard for quality, environment and 
security management. An evaluation of a potential supplier should include the potential 
supplier’s nuclear security culture, ensuring that the organisation and its leaders 
understand, or have the potential to understand, the importance of nuclear security 
and the contribution of any high-risk item or service they may supply to achieving the 
purchaser’s security plan requirements. 

7. 

SUPPLY CHAIN ORGANISATION AND TECHNICAL CAPABILITY 

7.4 

As part of the supplier selection process, the purchaser should confirm that suppliers 
have adequate oversight and assurance arrangements for their own suppliers. The

purchaser and suppliers should hold certification in accordance with recognised 
management system requirements, issued by the UK Accreditation Service (UKAS), or 
international equivalent, to ensure that appropriate quality management arrangements 
are in place and are being applied throughout the Supply Chain. This approach should 
not preclude purchasers from directly evaluating any level of the Supply Chain or 
carrying out oversight and assurance when work is in progress. All contracts should 
detail this right of access by the purchaser. 

7.5 

Purchasers should assure themselves that suppliers have competent personnel, 
particularly those carrying out key functions such as contract review, fabrication and 
inspection. The judgement on competency should be based on qualifications, training 
and experience using the supplier organisation’s own criteria and any applicable 
design code requirements for selection, employment and training of employees. A 
responsible person within the supplier organisation should assess each person 
involved for SQEPness against the post profiles and record acceptance and/or 
limitations, identifying how the latter will be addressed.   

Inspectors should consider: 

 

 
 

 
 

 

 
 

 
 

Is the purchaser’s process for evaluating suppliers of security significant 
items and services appropriately weighted to consider the quality and 
security requirements as a key part of the contract selection and award 
criteria? 

Do suppliers of security significant items and services currently have, and 
can maintain, sufficient SQEP personnel throughout the contract period? 

Does the supplier have the capacity to provide an enduring source of high-
risk items or services throughout the contract period?  

Has the purchasing organisation promulgated the required nuclear security 
culture with key suppliers? 

Do suppliers of security significant items or services understand the role of 
their products in achieving the dutyholder’s security plan requirements and 
are well-coordinated with the purchasers’ staff? 

Does the purchasing organisation and/or its suppliers monitor the 
performance of key individuals who are responsible for providing security 
significant high-risk items or services?  

8. 

SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS 

The purchaser should ensure that suppliers have quality management arrangements 
appropriate and consistent with the security significance of the procured items or 
services. 

Purchasers should ensure that supply organisations have management system 
arrangements appropriate to the items or services being supplied. These systems 
should be implemented and be able to meet relevant national or international; quality, 
environment and security management system requirements and be certified by UKAS 
or an equivalent international organisation.

8.9 

The purchaser’s management system arrangements should ensure that effective SCM, 
procurement, oversight and assurance arrangements are applied and are 
proportionate to the nuclear security significance of the items or services being 
procured. Arrangements should include comprehensive measures for the generation 
and control of quality plans and records, detailed further below, as key requirements in 
the effective procurement, manufacture and/or delivery of high-risk items and services. 

Quality Plans 

The purchaser should make clear in the contract the extent to which quality plans will 
be utilised. Quality Plans should be agreed with the purchaser prior to their use. The 
use of quality plans, developed by the supplier and agreed with the purchaser, is 
essential to ensure that items are fabricated, manufactured, erected, tested and 
inspected in a planned and controlled manner, and that the required levels of integrity 
are achieved and can be demonstrated within the required record/evidence package. 

Quality Plans allow the purchaser to check in advance that the supplier has fully 
understood the detailed requirements of the technical specification, and that the 
supplier has the necessary assurance activities to deliver items that will meet the 
technical specification and applicable codes and standards. Quality Plans also allow 
the purchaser, second party (supplier), independent third party inspection personnel, 
and, in some instances, ONR, to insert inspection points, witness points, review points 
or hold points into the manufacturing sequence. 

Quality Plans should include the full sequence of steps to deliver the item or service 
and details of hold point release. These need to be available for review by involved 
parties before work commences and in sufficient time to allow these parties to review 
and annotate them with hold, inspection, witness and review points and/or to question 
the sequence or referenced documents. 

Quality Plans, in identifying the sequence of activities required to satisfy the 
requirements of the contract, should reference process or fabrication instructions, 
tests, inspections and clearly identify the records required to be generated and 
provided to the purchaser. They should enable each stage of work to be signed for as 
being complete and also on the completion of work covered by each element of the 
plan. Proposed changes to quality plans before and during work commencement 
should be formally controlled and agreed by all the inspecting parties. 

A completed Quality Plan should demonstrate that all appropriate steps have been 
taken to deliver items or services to purchaser requirements, including details of the 
organisations involved and references to control documents and appropriate records.  

For complex items that are fabricated, manufactured or erected in stages, there may 
be several Quality Plans which support a top level quality plan. Quality Plan operations 
which are carried out by different organisations should make reference to the 
arrangements for releasing items or services from one to the other and the quality 
plans that control the ongoing work.  

8.10  A quality plan should identify or reference all those documents which form the 

purchaser’s document package and include such aspects as qualification of personnel, 
fabrication procedures, material certification and traceability, consumable specification, 
concessions and rework, manufacture, fabrication instructions, heat treatment records,

inspection and test results (including those from the purchaser, second, and third party 
inspection organisations). 

8.11  Quality Plans should identify steps for release, transport, handover and the process 

that will control the interfaces between organisations. The release process to the 
purchaser from the supplier should identify and record any approved deviations from 
contract requirements, specified intent and any outstanding actions. 

Records 

8.12  The importance of identification and retention of design, procurement, manufacturing, 

fabrication and inspection records cannot be overstated as these ultimately support the 
security plan. These should provide the evidence of assurance activities including 
those carried out by the supplier and sub-suppliers and in some cases the purchaser. 
Records also provide ONR with evidence of the application of assurance 
arrangements and can be used to demonstrate compliance. 

8.13  Records form part of the demonstration that structures, systems and components meet 

the design intent and nuclear security requirements. The identification, generation, 
timely completion, handover and retention of records associated with the supply of 
items or services, should form part of the contractual arrangements between purchaser 
and supplier at all levels of the Supply Chain.  

8.14  The purchaser should identify all the records required to be delivered to the purchaser 
during or on completion of the contract. Particular attention should be given to material 
traceability and inspection, test and surveillance activities. 

8.15  Tracking of record packages by unique reference and plant item unique numbers will 

aid interim and full system sign off prior to pre and post commissioning testing. The 
purchaser should develop the lifetime record package tracking process and ensure the 
supplier’s contract arrangements identify this process and their role within that 
process. 

Inspectors should consider:  

 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

Are the supplier’s management system arrangements appropriate to the 
risks of the items of services being supplied?  

Are Quality Plans comprehensive and inclusive of the full sequence of steps 
required to deliver the item or service, including references to assurance 
activities and applicable codes and standards? 

Do Quality Plans identify inspection/witness/review and hold points for all the 
required inspection parties? 

Are Quality Plans being adhered to and are they fully signed off after each 
step has been completed? 

Has the Purchaser put adequate contractual arrangements in place to 
ensure that relevant records are identified and provided by the Supply Chain 
in the correct form and to the required timescale?
