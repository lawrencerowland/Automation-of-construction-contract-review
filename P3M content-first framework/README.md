OBJECTIVE:
Have a body of Portfolio services that everyone can understand and use

Additional objective for those providing Portfolio Services:
Have a body of Portfolio services that is consistent between Sales and Delivery

**REASON FOR HAVING A SIMPLE DEPLOYABLE PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK

***Typical internal pain points

Content is hard to find, patchy, and out of date
Portfolio schemes are set up either from scratch or copy and paste. 
There is no standard way of delivering a service

**Typical external pain points for those competing to provide Portfolio services

Portfolio framework does not change from year to year
Inconsistent Bidding on a suite of services means we are only ever guessing at the best price, and will lose out
Engagements are only more or less related to services we have defined, and we risk Client discontent or action.
